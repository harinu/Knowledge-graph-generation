The inﬂammatory response is an adaptive mechanism that evolved to ﬁght against
infections and tissue damage. This complex mechanism is vital for the proper function of
the organism, and because of that, is under tight regulation involving a complex network
of factors, cells, and systems. Physiological inﬂammation is perfectly orchestrated to allow
the mobilization of leukocytes from the circulation to the injured tissues for the removal of
pathogens, tissue repair, and return to homeostasis. However, when the self-limited nature
of the inﬂammatory response and the mechanisms of resolution fail, inﬂammation might
become chronic, leading to the development of many disabling serious diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), or psoriasis.

Knowledge of the molecular and cellular processes underlying chronic inﬂammation
has substantially increased in recent decades. This resulted in enormous improvements in
the treatments for immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases, but also revealed the com-
plexity of the cytokine networks and immune cell subtypes involved in non-resolving
inﬂammatory responses. This fact could explain, in part, why certain groups of patients
are totally or partially refractory to current therapies. Therefore, we cannot be satisﬁed
with the available drugs, and more research focusing on deciphering the precise molecular
pathways behind uncontrolled inﬂammation is mandatory for developing novel therapeu-
tic approaches.

The 34 original and review articles included in this Special Issue contributed to the
aim of describing and understanding new mechanisms that trigger inﬂammation and
highlighted new putative treatments for different inﬂammatory conditions.

Neuroinﬂammation is a perfect example of the two faces of inﬂammation. While an
acute inﬂammatory response is protective, chronic neuroinﬂammation leads to inﬂamma-
tory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and it also contributes to other neurological [1]
and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [2]. Microglia is piv-
otal for regulating central nervous system inﬂammation. Therefore, it would be interesting
to develop therapeutic strategies conducted to mitigate their hyperactivation. Following
that aim, Saliba et al. synthesized a new antagonist for the orphan G-protein coupled
receptor 55, which decreased the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduced the activation
of pro-inﬂammatory signalling pathways [3]. In line with this, other receptors regulating
microglia function are being explored. This is the case for some purinergic receptors such
as P2Y receptors, whose actions on microglia and neuroinﬂammation were elegantly re-
viewed by Gómez Morillas et al. [4]. These data highlight that the isolation of new receptors
that can be pharmaceutically targeted might be relevant for treating neuroinﬂammatory
disorders. Actually, a similar approach is followed for other immune-mediated patholo-
gies, in which the inhibition of various receptors such as sodium-glucose co-transporter
2 [5], angiotensin receptor [6], or toll-like receptors [7] is being tested for controlling the

exacerbated inﬂammatory response during acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection, heart
failure, etc.

Focusing on autoimmune responses, Amend et al. [8] and Carvalheiro et al. [9] in-
vestigated the effects of IL-10 and angiopoietin-2 in the context of lupus and systemic
sclerosis, respectively. The former shed light on the poorly understood role played by
IL-10 in the development of lupus, revealing that IL-10 outcome depends on the complex
interplay among the different immune cells and the inﬂammatory microenvironment. The
latter investigated, for the ﬁrst time, how angiopoietin-2 can increase the production of
pro-inﬂammatory mediators by monocytes from systemic sclerosis patients, which could
contribute to the development of ﬁbrotic processes in the skin of those patients. Fibrosis is
also a key feature in chronic kidney injury, and Leong et al. [10] functionally demonstrated
in experimental acute kidney injury mouse models that cyclophilin inhibition protects from
renal injury and ﬁbrosis, an observation that is accompanied by reduced innate immune
cell inﬁltration.

Inﬂammation signiﬁcantly contributes to skin malignancies, as reviewed by
Ansary et al. [11] and Razib Hossain et al. [12]. Interestingly, Yang et al. [13] demonstrated
in vitro and in vivo the therapeutic potential of the natural small molecule neferine as an
anti-inﬂammatory drug for atopic dermatitis. Moreover, Hathaway-Schrader et al. [14]
showed new insights for a better comprehension of the immune evasion in melanoma cells.
Historically, inﬂammation-related research mainly comprised studies related to im-
mune cells and inﬂammatory mediators. However, in recent years, more multidisciplinary
and integrative approaches have been applied for the dissection of the inﬂammatory pro-
cess [15]. This is the case for the article by Weiss et al. [16], which showed an interesting
view of the participation of histone deacetylases in the activation of pro-inﬂammatory
signalling cascades and mediators in cultured macrophages. Moreover, another work
explored the methylation status of speciﬁc promoters for their participation in neuronal
inﬂammatory diseases. Hypermethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is
commonly observed in brain tumours. However, Teuber-Hanselmann et al. [17] reported
an original hypermethylation of that gene in inﬂammatory conditions affecting the central
nervous system. Likewise, the participation of adipokines and obesity in regulating in-
ﬂammation and cardiovascular disease [18,19] and the impact of the YAP/TAZ signalling
in the immunomodulatory responses of tumours [20] have also been discussed. Of note,
Götz et al. [21] demonstrated in vivo the relevance of the complement system in the recruit-
ment of neutrophils and M2-polarised macrophages to ischemic tissues, which, most likely,
are the most relevant players in the observed improvement of angiogenesis.

The impact of environmental factors such as pollutants, microparticles, or endocrine
disruptors is gaining interest. The latter is not only relevant for their interference with
the normal function of the endocrine system, but endocrine disruptors can also partici-
pate in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (as reviewed
by Cano et al.) by modulating liver metabolism [22]. In the same way, the food additive
titanium dioxide worsened experimental colitis in mice carrying IBD genetic risk muta-
tions [23], suggesting that the ingestion of industrial compounds can be detrimental to
patients with IBD with an increased genetic predisposition. Silicon dioxide is well-known
for causing lung silicosis, and novel pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment options
were reviewed by Adamcakova et al. [24]. Interestingly, Wang et al. [25] demonstrated the
efﬁcacy of a novel class of pharmacological compounds, namely SUL-151, in decreasing
neutrophilia after cigarette smoke exposure in mice.

This Special Issue also contains translational studies demonstrating the association
between high concentrations of IL-6 receptor antagonist and reduced carbohydrate dis-
orders and NAFLD progression in obese individuals [26], the impairment of circulating
monocytes and the aberrant production of pro-inﬂammatory mediators in spinal cord
injury patients [27], and the existence of a ﬁbroinﬂammatory signature in human follicular
ﬂuid of the female reproductive system [28]. Furthermore, Di Paola et al. [29] showed
the effects of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist Eltrombopag in the differentiation of

macrophages obtained from children with immune thrombocytopenia. Altogether, these
data show, in the human setting, how inﬂammation can also be at play in conditions not
typically recognised as immune-mediated diseases.

Finally, in this compilation of articles, we ﬁnd very interesting reviews updating a wide
variety of topics such as hypoalbuminemia as a surrogate of infections [30], the resolution
of inﬂammation in IBD or pain [31,32], the impact of inﬂammation in liver tumorigene-
sis and alcohol disease [33,34], and nutraceutical supplementation in obesity-associated
disorders [35]. Moreover, Rafael-Vidal et al. reviewed the potential use of calcineurin in-
hibitors to treat lupus nephritis [36], and the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating
osteoporosis after spinal cord injury were described by Shams et al. [37].

We hope the lectors will appreciate reading these papers. We thank all the authors and
reviewers for their dedication and proactive participation that made the realisation of this
remarkable Special Issue possible.
