Purpose: Sepsis is an aggressive and life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by infection. Excessive inflammation and coagula-
tion  contribute  to  the  negative  outcomes  for  sepsis,  resulting  in  high  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  this  study,  we  explored  whether 
Eupatilin could alleviate lung injury, reduce inflammation and coagulation during sepsis.
Methods:  We  constructed  an  in  vitro  sepsis  model  by  stimulating  RAW264.7  cells  with  1  μg/mL  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  for  6 
hours. The cells were divided into control group, LPS group, LPS+ Eupatilin (Eup) group, and Eup group to detect their cell activity 
and inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factor levels. Cells in LPS+Eup and Eup group were pretreated with Eupatilin (10μM) for 
2 hours. In vivo, mice were divided into sham operation group, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group and Eup group. Mice in the 
CLP  and  Eup  groups  were  pretreated  with  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  for  2  hours  by  gavage.  Lung  tissue  and  plasma  were  collected  and 
inflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors and signaling were measured.
Results:  In  vitro,  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-α,  interleukin  (IL)-1β,  IL-6,  and  tissue  factor  (TF)  expression  in  LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7  cells  was  downregulated  by  Eupatilin  (10μM).  Furthermore,  Eupatilin  inhibited  phosphorylation  of  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway and suppressed p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. In vivo, Eupatilin increased the survival rate of the mice. In septic 
mice, plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as TF, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), D-dimer, thrombin- 
antithrombin complex (TAT) and fibrinogen were improved by Eupatilin. Moreover, Eupatilin alleviated lung injury by improving the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF, fibrin deposition and macrophage infiltration in lung tissue.
Conclusion: Our results revealed that Eupatilin may modulate inflammation and coagulation indicators as well as improve lung injury 
in sepsis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
Keywords: Eupatilin, sepsis, inflammation, coagulation, JAK2/STAT3

Introduction
Sepsis  is  a  life-threatening  organ  dysfunction  caused  by  infection,  which  results  from  dysregulated  host  response.1 
A study reported in Lancet showed that sepsis remains a major cause of health loss worldwide, with 48.9 million cases 
each year and approximately 11 million deaths, which accounts around one-fifth of the total global deaths.2 According to 
Nature Reviews Disease Primers, more than half of sepsis patients are complicated with coagulation system imbalance.3 
Moreover,  in  patients  who  have  sepsis  with  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC)  the  mortality  rate  is  almost

twice that of sepsis patients without DIC.4  Therefore, reducing inflammation and coagulation disorders could be the key 
to reducing sepsis mortality.

Macrophages  are  involved  in  various  pathophysiological  processes  in  sepsis,  including  inflammation,  coagulation, 
immunity  and  metabolism,  and  play  a  crucial  role  in  sepsis-induced  acute  lung  injury.5,6  In  the  early  stages  of  sepsis, 
macrophages  engulf  pathogens  and  activate  the  innate  immune  system.  Macrophages  express  pattern  recognition 
receptors  (PRRs),  which  can  detect  pathogen-associated  molecular  patterns  (PAMPs)  or  damage-associated  molecular 
patterns (DAMPs), initiating a series of immune cell activations and upregulating the expression of inflammation-related 
genes, that produce a series of inflammatory cytokines.7 In this process, the body targets pathogens to contain, kill and/or 
expel  them.  However,  there  is  also  a  defense  strategy,  called  disease  tolerance,  which  refers  to  limiting  the  negative 
impact of infection on the host without affecting the pathogen load.8  The expression of high levels of PRRs and other 
receptors, including cytokines by tissue-resident macrophages contributes to the establishment of disease tolerance.9  In 
addition,  signal  transduction  pathways  that  are  activated  in  response  to  PAMPs  or  DAMPs  also  contribute  to  tissue 
damage control and establishment of disease tolerance, both of which limit the negative effects of infection.

Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  an  important  cell  wall  constituent  of  Gram-negative  bacteria,  is  a  potent  inducer  of 
inflammatory  responses.10  After  exposure  to  LPS,  macrophages  produce  large  amounts  of  inflammatory  cytokines, 
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).11 Recent studies have shown that monocytes and macrophages, 
especially  those  from  myeloid  origin,  are  main  cell  types  that  express  tissue  factor  (TF),  which  causes  pathological 
coagulation in sepsis.12,13  In severe sepsis, macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators and the coagulation system is 
activated, which promotes fibrin production and thrombosis.14,15  In addition, coagulation abnormalities contribute to the 
lethality of sepsis and septic acute lung injury (ALI).16 Many in vivo studies use cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model 
in mice, which can simulate the pathological condition of abdominal infection through cecal contamination and, to some 
extent, mimic the response of clinical patients with sepsis.17,18  Thus, we conducted sepsis model using LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP-induced mice in our study.

Eupatilin (Eup) is a lipophilic flavonoid isolated from Artemisia argyi, which has the effect of warming the meridian 
to stop bleeding, dispersing cold and relieving pain. In recent years, Eupatilin has been found to have biological activities 
against  inflammation,  oxidation,  and  tumors.19  It  has  antioxidant  and  anti-apoptotic  effects  against  cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity,  as  well  as  inhibiting  inflammatory  responses  and  aging  in  nucleus  pulposus  (NP)  cells.20,21  In  addition, 
a derivative of Eupatilin to treat dry eye disease is being developed and is undergoing Phase I study.22 Eupatilin can also 
reduce  the  inflammatory  response  in  LPS-induced  rats,  decreasing  the  level  of  surfactant  protein  (SP)-A,  SP-D,  and 
inflammatory  factors.23  Moreover,  Eupatilin  can  reduce  the  number  of  inflammatory  cells  in  OVA-induced  asthmatic 
mice  and  inhibit  the  NF-κB  and  MAPK  pathways  in  both  mice  and  RAW264.7  cells.24  Besides,  by inhibiting  STAT3, 
Eupatilin  attenuates  airway  remodeling  and  inhibits  gastric  cancer  cell  growth.25,26  A  recent  study  has  shown  that 
Eupatilin  is  associated  with  coagulation.  It  can  inhibit  arachidonic  acid  (AA)-induced  platelet  aggregation  and  throm-
boxane  A2  (TXA2)  and  5-hydroxytryptophan  (5-HT)  generation.27  Nevertheless,  the  underlying  mechanisms  and 
whether  it  can  be  used  to  protect  sepsis-induced  coagulation  disorders  is  unclear.  Besides,  our  previous  study  has 
shown that in sepsis, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 can affect the coagulation and inflammation systems, resulting 
in fatal damage.28

Thus,  we  hypothesized  that  Eupatilin  can  exert  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-coagulation  effects  in  LPS-induced 

RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP mouse model by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China).

Preparation of Eupatilin
In the in vitro experiments, Eupatilin was dissolved in DMSO to form a stock solution with a final concentration of 10 
mM,  and  stored  at  −80°C.  In  the  in  vivo  experiments,  Eupatilin  was  dissolved  in  80%  corn  oil  and  20%  DMSO  at 
a concentration of 10 mg/mL; the solution was used immediately after preparation.

In vitro
Cell Culture and Intervention
RAW264.7 macrophages were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultivated in DMEM with 10% FBS. 
The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37°C with a 5%CO2 level. Cells were randomly classified into four groups: 
control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + Eup group, and Eup group. The LPS group was stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS 
for 6 hours,30  while the LPS + Eup group was treated with 10 μM Eupatilin for 2 hours, followed by LPS for 6 hours. 
The Eup group was treated only with 10 μM Eupatilin, which was added the same time as LPS+ Eup group.

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay
The effects of Eupatilin on the proliferation of RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. The day 
before stimulation, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.0×104 cells/well. After 24 hours, the 
supernatant was replaced with fresh medium. The CCK-8 solution was then added into each well, and the mixture was 
incubated  at  37°C.  After  2  hours,  the  optical  density  at  450  nm  was  measured  using  a  microplate  reader  (Molecular 
Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).

Real Time Quantitative PCR
In  accordance  with  the  instructions,  the  total  RNA  from  RAW264.7  cells  was  extracted  and  1000  ng  of  RNA  was 
transformed into 20 μL cDNA using the reagents listed above. The cDNA was then stored at -80°C. The RT-qPCR was 
performed  using  SYBR  Green  on  a  PCR  detection  system  (7500fast,  USA).  The  cycling  conditions  were  as  follows: 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 60s, then denaturation at 95°C for 15s, annealing at 60°C for 30s, and extension at 72°C 
for  45s,  the  three  steps  above  cycled  for  40  times.  The  results  were  normalized  to  GAPDH  and  the  statistics  were 
calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The  primer pair  sequences for mice  were from Generay Biotech (Shanghai, China) 
and listed in Table 1.

In vivo
Experimental Animals
We obtained male C57BL/6 mice at the age of 6–8 weeks and the weight of 18–25 g from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory, 
Animal Limited Liability Company (SCXK (ZHE) 2019–0001). According to the local animal welfare policy, the mice 
were raised in a specific pathogen-free laboratory animal environment, in which the temperature maintained at 23 ± 3°C, 
the  humidity  kept  at  55%  ±  10%,  and  the  light/dark  cycle  controlled  at  12:12.  During  the  study,  the  mice  were  fed 
a normal diet. All animal experiments were complied with the requirements of the Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Wenzhou Medical University.  The animal  experimentation protocol  was granted by the Ethics Committee  of Wenzhou 
Medical University (YS2018-088, 2018.02.26).

Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) and Animal Tests
The  mice  were  randomly  assigned  into  three  groups  according  to  the  random  number  table  method:  sham  operation 
(SHAM) group, CLP group, CLP + Eup group. After the processing time, each group contained more than six samples. 
The  mice  were  anesthetized  by  1%  sodium  pentobarbital  (Solarbio,  China)  according  to  their  weight  (100  μL/10  g) 
before operation. After the mice were anesthetized, we opened the abdominal cavity and carefully exposed the cecum, 
which was then ligated at 1 cm from the end and punched through by a needle (21-gauge). Subsequently, the feces were 
squeezed  out  into  the  abdomen  and  the  cecum  was  placed  back.  Finally,  the  abdominal  cavity  was  closed.31  Similar 
procedures  without  ligation  and  puncture  were  used  in  the  SHAM  group.  For  the  CLP+Eup  group,  the  mice  were 
administered  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  by  gavage  2  hours  before  operation.  After  surgery,  each  mouse  was  immediately 
resuscitated  by  subcutaneous  injection  of  1  mL  warm  saline.  The  experimental  samples  were  collected  24  hours  after 
surgery. Besides, survival analysis was performed and lasted for 72 hours, with 10 mice per group, during which the mice 
were monitored every 6 hours and euthanized at the point of moribundity.

The  lung  tissue  from  three  groups  of  mice  were  collected,  fixed  in  4%  paraformaldehyde,  dehydrated,  embedded,  and 
sliced into 4-μm-thick sections. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the slices were stained by H&E staining kit. 
Then,  the  severity  of  lung  injury  was  evaluated  based  on  inflammatory  cell  infiltration,  edema  and  congestion.  The 
pulmonary injury was scored as follows: 0 point for no injury, 1 point for <25% of the field injured, 2 points for 25% to 
50% of the field injured, 3 points for 50% to 75% of the field injured, and 4 points for >75% of the field injured.32  Each 
slide  had  six  microscopic  fields  analyzed,  and  the  average  was  taken  as  the  final  score  for  each  lung  tissue.  Lung 
histological analyses were performed in a blinded manner.

Immunohistochemical Assay
The lung slices were dewaxed and rehydrated. Then, the antigen in slices was retrieved in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) 
for  10  minutes  using  a  microwave  oven,  followed  by  quenching  of  endogenous  peroxidase  for  15  minutes.  Next,  the 
sections  were  blocked  with  5%  BSA  for  an  hour.  The  slices  were  then  incubated  with  rabbit  anti-fibrinogen  antibody 
(Abcam,  Catalog  No:  ab34269)  overnight  at  4°C.  The  next  day,  the  slices  were  incubated  at  37°C  for  1h  with  HRP- 
conjugated  goat  anti-rabbit  antibody.  Subsequently,  the  slices  were  stained  using  a  DAB  kit  and  observed  under 
a microscope.

Elisa Test
The  supernatants  from  RAW264.7  cell  were  collected,  centrifuged  at  1000  ×  g  for  10  minutes  and  stored  at  −20°C. 
Twenty-four hours after surgery, the plasma was collected from mice using anticoagulant tubes with 3.2% sodium citrate. 
The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 minutes and stored at − 80°C. The experiment was performed according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  catalog  numbers  for  the  reagent  kits  were  as  follows:  IL-1β  (Catalog  No:70- 
EK201B),  IL-6  (Catalog  No:70-EK206)  and  TNF-α  (Catalog  No:70-EK282)  from  MultiScience,  China.  TF  (Catalog

(TAT) (Catalog No: CSB-E08433m) from Cusabio, China.

Western Blotting
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  lung  tissue  from  mice  were  dissociated  by  RIPA  buffer  with  10%  protein  phosphatase 
inhibitor and 1% PMSF. After measuring the protein concentrations using the BCA kit, lysates containing 20 µg protein 
samples were separated on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After that, the proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF 
membranes  in  a  cold  condition;  these  membranes  were  then  blocked  using  5%  skim  milk  in  1  ×  TBST  buffer  for  1.5 
hours at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. 
On the second day, the membranes were incubated with goat HRP-conjugated IgG antibodies (Catalog No: SA00001-2 
for anti-rabbit or Catalog No: SA00001-1 for anti-mice, Proteintech, China) for 1 hour at room temperature. The proteins 
were then visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence reagent. The primary antibodies were as follows: STAT3 (Catalog 
No:  9139S)  and  p-STAT3  (Try705)  (Catalog  No:  9145S)  from  Cell  Signaling  Technology,  USA.  TF  (Catalog  No: 
DF6400), IL-6 (Catalog No: DF6087), TNF-α (Catalog No: AF7014), IL-1β (Catalog No: AF5103), GAPDH (Catalog 
No: AF7021), Tubulin (Catalog No: AF7011), and Histone H3 (Catalog No: BF9211) are from Affinity, China. p-JAK2 
(pY1007+Y1008) (Catalog  No:  ab32101),  JAK2  (Catalog  No:  ab108596),  thrombin  (Catalog  No:  ab92621) and  PAI-1 
(Catalog  No:  ab222754)  from  Abcam  (Cambridge,  United  Kingdom).  The  internal  reference  proteins  in  this  study 
included GAPDH, Tubulin, and Histone H3. ImageJ software (NIH, USA) was used to quantify the protein bands.

Immunofluorescence
For  cell  immunofluorescence,  macrophages  were  fixed  with  4%  paraformaldehyde  for  10  min,  permeabilized  in  0.2% 
Triton  X-100  for  15  minutes,  and  blocked  in  5%  BSA  for  30  minutes.  All  the  operations  were  performed  at  room 
temperature.  Then,  the  cells  are  incubated  with  p-STAT3  primary  antibodies  overnight  at  4°C,  followed  by  incubation 
with FITC secondary antibodies against the appropriate sources for 1 hour at 37°C (Catalog No: BL031A for anti-mice or 
Catalog  No:  BL033A  for  anti-rabbit,  Biosharp).  Thereafter,  the  sections  were  mounted  using  an  anti-fluorescence 
quencher containing DAPI (Catalog No:36308ES11, Yeasen, China).

For tissue immunofluorescence staining, lung sections were treated the same way as for immunohistochemistry, then 
incubated  with  the  F4/80  (Catalog  No:  sc-377009,  Santa  Cruz)  and  TF  (Catalog  No:  DF6400,  Affinity)  primary 
antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following day, the slides were performed in the same way as for cell immunofluores-
cence.  Finally,  we  visualized  the  fluorescence  signal  in  the  tissue  and  cells  using  a  laser  confocal  microscope  (Nikon, 
Japan). The statistical significance was estimated using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).

Statistical Analyses
GraphPad Prism  9.0.0  (GraphPad  Software,  USA)  was  used  for  the  statistical  analysis. Each  experiment  was  indepen-
dently  carried  out  in  at  least  three  duplicates.  Values  were  presented  as  mean ± SD.  P  <  0.05  was  considered  to  be 
statistically  significant.  After  evaluating  normality  and  variance  in  each  group,  the  group  differences  were  examined 
using  one-way  ANOVA,  followed  by  Tukey’s  post-hoc  multiple  comparison  test.  The  analysis  was  carried  out  to 
determine the statistical methods for comparison between groups. The Log rank test was used to compare the survival 
time in each group of mice.

Results
Effects of Eupatilin on Cell Viability
To assess the effect of Eupatilin on cell viability and cytotoxicity, we examined the effect of Eupatilin on RAW 264.7 
macrophages  using  the  CCK8  assay.  As  shown  in  Figure  1B,  the  cell  viability  of  RAW  264.7  macrophages  was  little 
affected  within  24  hours  at  concentrations  less  than  10μM.  Thus,  in  the  following  experiments,  we  used  a  10μM 
concentration  of  Eupatilin  to  eliminate  any  potential  cytotoxic  effect.  Besides,  the  result  of  CCK8  also  showed  that 
LPS  induced  cell  proliferation  in  macrophages,  while  Eupatilin  could  inhibit  the  LPS-induced  cell  proliferation 
(Figure 1C).

Eupatilin Decreased the Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and TF in LPS-Induced 
RAW264.7 Cells
To explore the effect of Eupatilin, we measured inflammatory cytokines and TF levels in RAW264.7 cells six hours after 
LPS stimulation. As shown in Figure 1D-F, after the stimulation with LPS, the mRNA expression raised sharply in TNF- 
α (25.15±4.10), IL-1β (3753.55±114.04) and IL-6 (36976.14±1121.44). However, pretreatment with Eupatilin apparently 
attenuated  the  LPS-induced  increase  in  inflammatory  cytokine  expression.  TF  is  a  major  promoter  of  coagulation.  As 
shown in Figure 1G, Eupatilin apparently inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression of TF (84.66±4.86 in LPS group vs 
48.49±3.39 in LPS+Eup group).

Western blot and ELISA were performed to examine the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF at the protein 
level. In the supernatants from the LPS group, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were higher than the control 
group, whereas this increase was significantly reduced in the LPS + Eup group (Figure 1H-J, 19,615.96±714.41pg/mL, 
26.24±2.44pg/mL and 2590.58±109.74pg/mL in LPS group vs 17,095.77±140.07pg/mL, 19.10±1.79pg/mL and 1796.74 
±256.63pg/mL  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively).  Moreover,  the  Western  blot  results  illustrated  that  pretreatment  with 
Eupatilin significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 1K-N). Both 
the Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated the reduction in the expression of inflammation indicators in the RAW 
264.7 cells after using Eupatilin. Western blot analysis also revealed a decrease in TF expression in the LPS + Eup group 
(Figure 1K and O).

Eupatilin Regulated LPS-Induced Inflammation and Coagulation by Suppressing JAK2/ 
STAT3 Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells
To  observe  whether  Eupatilin-mediated  effects  on  inflammation  and  coagulation  were  linked  to  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling  pathway,  we  performed  Western  blot  in  RAW264.7  cells  to  detect  the  phosphorylation  of  target  proteins. 
Compared with the CON group, the LPS group had significantly higher expression levels of both p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. 
However,  after  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin,  the  expression  levels  of  both  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  were  diminished 
(Figure  2A-C,  1.48±0.02  and  3.10±0.14  in  LPS  group  vs  1.21±0.06  and  2.38±0.11  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively). 
AG490  is  an  inhibitor  of  JAK2,  which  reduced  the  phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  (Figure  2D).  Western  blot 
analysis  revealed  that  AG490  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  both  STAT3  and  JAK2,  while  Eupatilin  pretreatment 
strengthened this inhibition (Figure 2E-G). Moreover, comparing with CLP group, the use of AG490 could reduce the 
expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TF (Figure 2H-K, 15.09±1.61, 1843.46±85.28, 18,345.62±427.00, and 55.24±1.82 
in  LPS  group  vs  11.71±0.17,  1170.53±41.54,  4321.65±241.26,  and  38.15±3.08  in  LPS+AG490  group,  respectively), 
while the use of Eupatilin strengthened this inhibition.

To  verify  whether  Eupatilin  pretreatment  can  reduce  p-STAT3  nuclear  translocation  in  LPS-stimulated  RAW264.7 
cells,  both  Western  blot  and  immunofluorescence  were  performed.  Western  blot  analysis  showed  that  the  pretreatment 
with  Eupatilin  attenuated  the  expression  of  p-STAT3  in  nucleus  (Figure  3A).  In  addition,  cell  immunofluorescence 
showed  a  reduction  in  the  nuclear  translocation  of  p-STAT3  after  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  in  RAW264.7  cells 
(Figure 3B).

Figure 2 Effects of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. (A-C) The phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in RAW264.7 cells was analyzed by 
Western  blot.  (D)  The  phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  in  RAW264.7  cells  after  using  AG490  alone  for  7  hours  was  analyzed  by  Western  blot.  (E-G)  The 
phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  in  RAW264.7  cells  after  pretreatment  with  AG490  and  AG490  plus  Eupatilin  were  analyzed  by  the  Western  blot.  The  relative 
expression levels of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were normalized to JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. (H-K) The differences in TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and TF mRNA 
expression were determined by RT-qPCR. Before receiving LPS (1 μg/mL) for 6 hours, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with AG490 (10 µM) for 1 hour. n≥3 per group, one- 
way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, versus LPS group; $ p < 0.05, $$ p < 0.01, $$$ p < 0.001, versus LPS+AG490 
group.

Eupatilin Increased Survival Rate and Improved Inflammation and Coagulation in Septic 
Mice
To investigate the effect of Eupatilin on the survival rate of septic mice, we established a model using CLP with C57BL/6 
mice and calculated the 72-hour survival rate. The results showed that compared with SHAM group, the survival rate in 
CLP group dropped sharply (Figure 4A, 1/10,10% in CLP group vs 10/10,100% in SHAM group). Moreover, compared 
to mice in CLP group, the survival rate in CLP+Eup group increased (5/10, 50%).

Figure 3 Effects of Eupatilin on the translocation of p-STAT3 into the nuclei in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with LPS. (A) The protein levels of p-STAT3 in the nuclei of 
RAW264.7 cells were determined by Western blot. (B) p-STAT3 (green) fluorescence images of RAW264.7 cells (scale bar: 50 µm, 600 ×) were captured under a confocal 
laser microscope. n≥3 per group, one-way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, versus LPS group.

To  explore  whether  Eupatilin  improves  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  mouse  model,  ELISA was  performed.  As 
anticipated,  the  level  of  inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  TNF-α,  IL-1β  and  IL-6  (241.72±30.17pg/mL,  33.59±2.25pg/ 
mL,  213.99±75.66ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  141.52±19.96pg/mL,  25.80±4.05pg/mL,  41.36±17.86ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup 
group,  respectively),  as  well  as  coagulation  factors,  such  as  TF,  TAT,  PAI-1  and  D-dimer  (82.24±4.89pg/mL,  42.79 
±8.39ng/mL,  233.75±82.02ng/mL,  31.80±3.14ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  68.21±  2.50pg/mL,  12.60±2.90ng/mL,  23.91 
±21.07ng/mL,  23.33±1.78ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup  group,  respectively),  were  lower  in  the  plasma  for  mice  in  CLP+Eup 
group (Figure 4B-H) than those in the CLP group. In addition, compared with the SHAM group, the fibrinogen level in 
plasma  was  decreased  in  the  CLP  group,  while  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  reversed  this  trend  (Figure  4I,  497.13 
±21.69µg/mL in CLP group vs 705.19±138.68µg/mL in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Eupatilin Alleviated Pulmonary Inflammation and Lung Injury in Septic Mice
We performed H&E staining to detect lung injury. H&E staining revealed that in the CLP models, the alveolar wall was 
thickened, hyaline membranes were formed, and neutrophils had accumulated in the interstitial space. As anticipated, the 
CLP+Eup group exhibited slighter lung tissue injury (Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines in 
lung tissue among the three groups was analyzed. As shown in Figure 5B-E, Eupatilin reduced the expression of TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue of mice. Macrophages initiate the primary inflammatory process, and F4/80 is a biomarker 
for them. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the CLP group had stronger F4/80 fluorescent signals than the 
sham group, while Eupatilin pretreatment decreased these signals (Figure 5F).

Eupatilin Reduced Coagulation and Fibrin Deposition in the Lung Tissue of Septic Mice
We used Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to investigate whether Eupatilin reduces 
coagulation  in  lung  tissue.  The  exposure  of  TF  is  the  way  to  promote  coagulation.  The  results  of  Western  blot  and 
immunofluorescence showed that Eupatilin could lower the exposure of TF in the lung tissue of septic mice (Figure 6A, 
B  and  E). Furthermore,  Western blot showed  decreased  expression  levels of  thrombin,  and PAI-1  in the lung  tissue  of 
septic mice after Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 6A, C and D). Additionally, according to immunohistochemistry results, 
fibrin deposition (brown stain) was observed in the CLP group. However, the amount of fibrin deposition was less in the

Eupatilin Suppressed the Activation of JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway in the Lung 
Tissue of Septic Mice
To explore the effect of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we extracted proteins from the lung tissue of septic mice. 
The  Western  blot  analysis  revealed  that  the  expression  of  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  was  considerably  higher  in  the  CLP 
group than in the SHAM  group, and decreased  with  Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 7A-C,  1.79±0.24 and  2.21±0.20 in 
CLP group vs 1.24±0.16 and 1.11±0.15 in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Discussion
One  of  the  pathological  features  of  sepsis  is  the  hyperactivation  of  inflammation  and  coagulation  systems;  both  can 
promote  and  impact  upon  each  other.33  In  the  present  study,  we  found  that  Eupatilin  reduced  the  expression  of 
inflammatory  factors  and  tissue  factors  in  LPS-induced  RAW264.7  cells  in  vitro  and  increased  the  survival  of  CLP 
mice. In vivo, Eupatilin attenuated lung injury and reduced inflammatory infiltration and coagulation activation in CLP

mice.  In  summary,  our  research  revealed  that  Eupatilin  could  protect  septic  mice  from  lung  injury,  by  improving 
inflammation and coagulation, and that this protection was linked to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Ample evidence suggests extensive interaction between inflammation and coagulation, with inflammation activating 
coagulation  and  coagulation  greatly  influencing  inflammatory  activity.34  In  sepsis  patients,  high  concentrations  of 
cytokines  can  be  found  in  blood  circulation.15  The  first  mediator  identified  is  TNF,  which  is  then  followed  by  various 
IL with noticeably elevated levels—IL-6 and IL-1 being the most significant.35 Our research showed that, in both in vivo 
and in vitro sepsis models, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were increased.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines have the ability to stimulate coagulation in vitro. TF is the main factor in the coagulation 
process  and  is  also  a  link  between  coagulation  and  inflammation.36–39  Under  normal  physiological  conditions,  mono-
cytes,  endothelial  cells  and  epithelial  cells  have  low  TF  expression.40  However,  during  sepsis,  these  cells  express  and 
release TF into circulation after being stimulated by inflammatory factors and LPS.13,41  Besides, after LPS stimulation, 
caspase-11 is activated, followed by gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores formed and phosphatidylserine exposure, triggering 
the  coagulation  cascade.42  Previous  research  has  also  demonstrated  that  blocking  IL-6  inhibits  endotoxin-induced 
coagulation  activation.43  Numerous  investigations  have  shown  that  the  stimulation  of  human  monocytes  with  LPS 
increases  TF  expression.40,44  Moreover,  healthy  humans  who  received  a  low-dose  endotoxemia  injection  had  a  125- 
fold increase in the amount of TF mRNA in their circulating monocytes.45,46  In a model of endotoxemia, early research 
showed  that  inhibiting  the  expression  of  TF  attenuated  septic  shock,  and  animals  with  low  TF  levels  had  decreased

Figure 7 Effects of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in lung tissue of septic mice. (A-C) The phosphorylation levels of JAK2 and STAT3 in septic mice were

coagulation,  inflammation,  and  mortality.47  In  our  study,  we  discovered  that  TF  expression  was  noticeably  higher  in 
sepsis models, while the pretreatment with Eupatilin reversed these changes.

After  the  release  of  TF,  it  binds  to  activated  factor  VII(VIIa),  forming  the  TF–FVIIa  complex,  which  can  induce 
a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages.48  The TF–VIIa complex then activates factor X and initiates coagulation 
activation.  Factor  Xa,  together  with  factor  Va,  forms  the  prothrombinase  complex,  which  subsequently  converts 
prothrombin  to  thrombin.49  It  can  amplify  inflammation  by  binding  to  platelets  and  protease  activated  receptor  1 
(PAR-1).50  Thrombin  then  cleaves  fibrinogen  into  fibrin,51  and  fibrin  degradation  products can  induce  IL-6  production 
by monocytes in vitro.52  Moreover, fibrin degradation can elevate the levels of D-dimer. This process produces higher 
levels of PAI-1, and the overproduction of which will impair fibrinolysis.53  Increased fibrin formation due to impaired 
fibrinolysis causes organ injury and mortality in sepsis.54

According to a number of studies, the STAT3 signaling pathway can regulate inflammatory responses in LPS-induced 
macrophages  and  acute  lung  injury,  including  the  production  and  release  of  inflammatory  factors.55–58  In  our  previous 
study, we found that activation of the nuclear transcription factor STAT3 through phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 site 
induced TF expression and facilitated the onset of coagulation dysfunction in sepsis.28 In addition, the use of the STAT3 
inhibitor BP-1-102 decreased the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TF 
in RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, our present experiments detected phosphorylation of STAT3 in both mice lung tissue and 
LPS-stimulated macrophages sepsis models, and increased intranuclear phosphorylation was found in macrophages, both 
of which are in agreement with previous studies.29

However,  other  mechanisms  may  also  be  involved  in  Eupatilin’s  effects.  Studies  have  shown  that  Eupatilin  is 
a  selective  PPARα-receptor  agonist,  the  activation  of  PPARα  may  be  related  to  the  alleviation  of  inflammation  and 
oxidative  stress  in  LPS-induced  ALI.23,59  Eupatilin  has  also  been  found  to  reduce  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
cytokines by inhibiting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).60  However, whether it has specific receptors requires further study. 
In addition, Eupatilin may also play a role in other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, MAPK and Nrf2 pathways.24,61 
Thus,  whether  these  pathways  also  play  a  role  in  regulating  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  sepsis  needs  further 
investigation.  According  to  one  study,  Eupatilin  can  lower  the  expression  of  inflammatory  mediators  by  inhibiting  the 
NF-κB signaling pathway in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages.62  However, the specific mechanism of its regulation of 
macrophages and its effect on pathogens has not been elucidated yet.

In our study, we found that the effect of Eupatilin pretreatment on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and tissue 
factors  was  consistent  in  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  experiments.  Eupatilin-mediated  effects in  vivo  were  maintained  in 
both plasma and lung tissues. Moreover, the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was observed in both lung 
tissue and cells after Eupatilin pretreatment. Similar to Eupatilin, another plant-based molecule, piperlongumin, also has

regulatory effects on inflammation and  coagulation in severe infections,  and further studies are needed to  compare the 
effects of these compounds.29

However, our study also has some limitations. First of all, endothelial cells also play an important role in inflamma-
tion and coagulation disorders caused by sepsis. However, we did not perform analysis on endothelial cells in the present 
study. Secondly, the study was performed only in C57BL/6 mice and was not validated in other murine species. Finally, 
we only used a single dose and intervention time in our study, so further studies should be conducted to investigate the 
optimum concentration and intervention time for Eupatilin-related effects.

Conclusion
Our results confirmed that Eupatilin can reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factors in both 
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  mouse  sepsis  models.  It  also  increased  survival  and  attenuated  lung  injury  in  mice  with 
sepsis.  The  mechanism  for  this  may  involve  the  inhibition  of  JAK2/STAT3  activation  and  the  reduction  of  p-STAT3 
nuclear  translocation,  thereby  regulating  inflammatory  cytokines  and  coagulation  factors.  Additionally,  the  potential 
mechanisms and effects of Eupatilin on other organs in sepsis require further investigation.
