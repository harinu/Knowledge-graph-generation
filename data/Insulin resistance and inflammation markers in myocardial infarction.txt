Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and is regarded as an important mechanism in disease pathogenesis. One of the key pathogenetic 
mechanisms  of  IR  progression  is  impaired  free  fatty  acid  (FFA)  metabolism.  Plasminogen-
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and key inflammation markers, ie, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP), also play a role.
Purpose: To assess the changing levels of the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, 
CRP and PAI-1 and their association with the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
in myocardial infarction (MI) patients during their hospital stay.
Methods: The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included 95 nondiabetic MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 40 diabetic MI patients. The control group consisted of 30 sex- 
and age-matched volunteers. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels as well as FFA, glucose, C-peptide, 
insulin, and plasma PAI-1 concentrations were measured at days 1 and 12 from MI onset.
Results: At day 1, there was an increase in glucose concentrations, which remained high in both 
groups by day 12 but was much higher in the diabetic patients. Basal insulin and C-peptide levels 
did not differ significantly from those in the control group. The quantitative insulin sensitivity-
check index in both groups was significantly different from that in controls. FFA concentrations 
at day 1 in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients increased; by day 12, they had decreased but 
were still higher than the controls. CRP and IL-6 levels at day 1 were higher in all the patients, 
but diabetic patients had the highest levels; by day 12, the levels were lower but still 2.4-fold 
(IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than those in the control group.
Conclusion: This  study  showed  that  MI  is  accompanied  both  by  activated  inflammatory 
response and IR. Strong correlations between IL-6 and FFA concentrations demonstrate that 
nonspecific inflammation factors are involved in IR development in MI patients. Consequently, 
these inflammatory cytokines might cause the development of IR.
Keywords: insulin resistance, myocardial infarction, inflammation, type 2 diabetes mellitus

Introduction
Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes mel-
litus (T2DM), and is traditionally regarded as an important stage of its pathogenesis: 
IR in general and diabetic populations is associated with cardiovascular risk factors 
including hyperglycemia, dyslipoproteinemia, arterial hypertension, obesity, throm-
bosis, and smoking.1,2

Large clinical trials showed that IR was a predictor of such cardiovascular events 
as ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI).3,4 Additionally, it was estab-
lished that the course of MI as a separate disease is accompanied by IR development

and that the pathogenetic mechanisms are unclear. Medical 
literature has, among others, the following possible reasons 
for IR development: activation of local inflammation in the 
area of atherosclerotic lesion and infarct site with enhanced 
expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and acute-
phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP), as their 
key  representative.5 An  important  role  of  increased  CRP 
levels not only as an MI predictor and a marker of adverse 
outcome  but  also  as  a  precursor  of  IR  development  was 
established earlier.6 High CRP levels are thought to result 
in a change in insulin-action regulation at the cellular level, 
which could lead to IR.7

Among  proinflammatory  cytokines  contributing  to 
IR  development,  the  role  of  interleukin  (IL)-6,  which  has 
autocrine and paracrine properties and is involved in insulin 
reception and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism regulation, 
has been extensively studied. The increase in FFA concen-
trations in myocardial ischemia could also lead to a reduced 
sensitivity to insulin in the peripheral tissues.8,9 Moreover, 
previous experimental studies demonstrated that IL-6 could 
induce plasminogen-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 production. 
Its  activity  increase  is  regarded  both  as  a  risk  factor  for 
coronary atherothrombosis and MI and as a trigger for IR 
 development.10 PAI-1 is known to modulate insulin signal-
ing  in  fibroblasts,  preventing  vitronectin  binding  to  αvβ3-
receptors, which in turn decreases insulin-induced protein 
kinase B phosphorylation.11

According  to  Juhan-Vague  et  al,  obese  patients  with 
hyperinsulinemia  and  a  genotype  associated  with  the 
increased PAI-1 transcription had a high risk of MI.12 Thus, 
an analysis of the medical literature allows the suggestion that 
proinflammatory factors could be involved in IR development 
in acute coronary events. The detection of a possible associa-
tion between metabolic changes, indicators, and nonspecific 
inflammation markers in MI patients, including those with 
T2DM, can play a role in the choice of treatment strategy in 
terms of risk stratification in this category of patients.

This study was aimed at assessing the changing levels of 
the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, CRP and 
PAI-1,  and  their  association  with  presence  or  absence  of 
T2DM in MI patients during their hospital stay.

Materials and methods
Study subjects and design
A total of 155 MI patients (95 males and 60 females), mean 
age 65 ± 4.5 years, and 30 sex- and age-matched volunteers 
(the control group) with no cardiovascular or endocrine dis-
eases were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided 

into  two  groups:  group  I  comprised  95  nondiabetic  MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 60 diabetic MI patients. The 
mean T2DM duration was, on average, 6.4 ± 1.5 years. The 
groups were sex- and age-matched and had similar risk fac-
tors for ischemic heart disease, concurrent conditions, and 
MI complication rate.

The main demographic characteristics of the study patients 
are summarized in Table 1. The patient groups were similar in 
age, sex, main risk factors of ischemic heart disease, comor-
bidities, and coronary event incidence (Table 1). The study 
excluded patients older than 75 years and/or with clinically 
significant concurrent conditions (autoimmune diseases, thy-
roid gland, or adrenal gland diseases). However, there were 
more obese patients among those with T2DM compared to 
nondiabetic patients, according to body mass index (BMI) lev-
els: 29.65 (26.85–34.55) kg/m2 vs 25.5 (23.2–30.1) kg/m2.

Acute MI was diagnosed according to the 2007 Russian 
National  Cardiology  Society  guidelines  based  on  clinical, 
electrocardiographic,  echocardiographic,  and  biochemical 
signs of the disease. The inclusion criteria were chest pain 
refractory to nitroglycerin, myocardial ischemia, and necro-
sis  signs  (ST-segment  elevation  and/or  new  pathologic  Q 
waves on the electrocardiogram, elevated cardiac enzymes: 
MB fraction of creatine kinase [CK MB] and troponin T).

Insulin resistance and inflammation markers in MI

Peak CK MB and troponin T levels did not differ between 
the groups. Peak CK MB levels were 94.03 ± 17.9 U/L and 
137.64 ± 41.1 U/L in the diabetic and nondiabetic patients, 
respectively  (P  =  0.916);  troponin T  concentrations  were 
1.09 ± 0.92 ng/mL and 0.71 ± 0.41 ng/mL in the diabetic 
and nondiabetic patients, respectively (P = 0.564).

The  exclusion  criteria  were  age  .75  years,  clinically 
significant comorbidities (autoimmune diseases, thyroid or 
adrenal gland diseases), acute coronary syndrome as a com-
plication of percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary 
artery bypass surgery.

The patient groups had a similar incidence of major hos-
pital coronary events (Table 1). Eighty percent of patients 
in both groups did not have any signs of acute heart failure, 
according to the Killip classification (1967) upon admission 
and during the hospital stay (Table 1); however, more than 
50% of patients had arrhythmias and impaired conduction 
diagnosed according to the established criteria.13 The struc-
ture and function of the left ventricle did not differ between 
the  groups.  Mean  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  was 
51.25% ± 1.85% in the diabetic patients and 50.42% ± 1.62% 
in those without T2DM (P = 0.598); mean left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume was 164.35 ± 10.47 mL in the diabetic 
patients and 156.43 ± 7.18 mL in the nondiabetic patients 
(P = 0.649); mean left ventricular end-systolic volume was 
79.71 ± 8.32 mL in the diabetic patients and 75.22 ± 5.56 in 
the nondiabetic patients (P = 0.702).

The groups were similar in the presence/type of coronary 
artery  disease:  coronary  angiography  showed  multivessel 
(more  than  three  vessels)  hemodynamically  significant 
coronary artery lesions in both groups (76.5% in the diabetic 
patients and 62.5% in the nondiabetic patients [P = 0.857]). 
T2DM  compensation  was  evaluated  based  on  glycated 
hemoglobin  levels  (T2DM  was  considered  to  be  compen-
sated in glycated hemoglobin .7.5%, according to the 2000 
European Diabetes Policy Group criteria). Decompensated 
T2DM was diagnosed in eight (40%) patients.

The  study  design  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review Board of the Research Institute for Complex Issues 
of  Cardiovascular  Diseases;  all  the  individuals  signed  the 
informed consent before being enrolled in the study. Thera-
peutic interventions during the follow-up period are listed 
in Table 2.

Assays
Serum IL-6 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay at days 1 and 12 from the MI onset 
using Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) test-systems.

CRP,  serum  FFA,  and  glucose  concentrations  were  mea-
sured at the same study time points using standard Thermo 
Fisher Scientific (Vantaa, Finland) test systems on a Konelab 
30i  biochemistry  analyzer  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific  Oy, 
Vantaa, Finland). C-peptide and insulin concentrations were 
measured  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  with 
BioMedica (Waterloo, NSW, Australia) and Diagnostic Sys-
tems Laboratories (Webster, TX, USA) lab kits, respectively. 
Plasma  PAI-1  concentrations  were  assessed  with  standard 
Technoclone  (Vienna, Austria)  test  systems. Additionally, 
all the patients had their postprandial glycemia, insulin, and 
C-peptide concentrations measured 2 hours after a standard 
carbohydrate breakfast (75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved 
in 250–300 mL water to drink for 3–5 minutes on an empty 
stomach).

The IR level was estimated using a structural mathemati-
cal model incorporating fasting serum insulin and glucose 
measurement with the quantitative insulin sensitivity-check 
index (QUICKI) calculation. QUICKI  = 1/(log [I0] + log 
[G0]),  where  I0  –  basal  insulinemia  (mg/dL),  G0  –  basal 
glycemia  (mME/mL). According  to  Katz  et  al,  a  mean 
QUICKI  value  of  0.382  ±  0.007  correlates  with  normal 
tissue  sensitivity  to  insulin,  while  QUICKI  values  of 
0.331 ± 0.010 and 0.304 ± 0.007 correlate with moderate 
and severe IR.14

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney  test  for  unpaired  samples  and  the Wilcoxon  test 
for  paired  samples. The  results  were  presented  as  median 
and quartiles. P-values , 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated 
to analyze the correlations between the variables. The statis-
tical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, 
Tulsa, OK, USA).

Results
The  diabetic  and  nondiabetic  MI  patients  were  found  to 
have a 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold increase (respectively) in blood 
glucose  levels  at  day  1  compared  to  those  in  the  control 
group  (Table  3). The  increase  in  basal  glucose  levels  was 
still present at day 12 in both patient groups, but was more 
pronounced  in  the  diabetic  patients.  Postprandial  glucose 
concentrations were 2.6-fold increased in the individuals with 
MI and T2DM at day 12, while in the nondiabetic patients 
postprandial glucose levels decreased compared to the basal 
levels but did not reach those in the controls.

Unlike glucose concentrations, fasting serum insulin and 
C-peptide levels had a tendency towards increasing in both 
groups at days 1 and 12 after MI onset, but did not differ from 
those in the controls (Table 3). The change in postprandial 
levels of those parameters at day 12 was more significant. 
Indeed,  postprandial  insulin  concentrations  both  in  the 
diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients crept up in an almost 
similar way compared to the control and basal levels.

Despite the fact that the changes in glucose metabolism 
were less pronounced in the nondiabetic MI patients, the inte-
gral QUICKI of IR in both groups significantly differed from 
that in the controls. In the controls, the QUICKI value was 
0.38 ± 0.01 and corresponded to the normal tissue sensitiv-
ity to insulin. In the group of nondiabetic patients, QUICKI 
values were 0.316 ± 0.005 and 0.319 ± 0.005 at days 1 and 
12, respectively, which were regarded as borderline values 
between  severe  and  moderate  IR.  In  diabetic  MI  patients, 
QUICKI values were 0.296 ± 0.009 and 0.300 ± 0.005, which 
according to Katz et al corresponded to severe IR.14

Analysis of FFA concentration changes in MI patients 
showed significant differences compared to the controls both 
at day 1 and at day 12 of the disease (Table 4). At day 1, FFA 
concentrations in both diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients 
were seven- and elevenfold higher than those in the controls, 
respectively. By day 12, the levels had decreased, but were 
still three- and 4.7-fold higher than those in the controls; thus, 
in patients with such comorbidity, these changes were more 
pronounced during the entire follow-up period.

PAI-1 concentrations were found to be increased in both 
groups, but at the same time at day 1 the diabetic MI patients 
had  a  4.6-fold  increase  in  PAI-1  levels  compared  to  the 
 controls (Table 4). These values were, on average, twofold 
higher than those in the nondiabetic patients. At day 12 from 
MI onset, PAI-1 concentrations significantly decreased in both 
groups; however, they did not reach the control levels.

Measurement of the key inflammation markers showed 
that  at  day  1,  the  whole  study  population  had  3.6-  and

19-fold increased IL-6 and CRP concentrations, respectively 
(Table 5). At the same time, the diabetic patients had more 
pronounced changes in the levels of inflammation markers: 
IL-6  and  CRP  concentrations  were  5.3-fold  and  26-fold 
higher,  respectively  (Table  3). At  day  12,  IL-6  and  CRP 
concentrations had decreased in both groups, but were still 
on average 2.4-fold (IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than 
those in the controls, the diabetic MI patients having higher 
IL-6 and CRP levels during the entire follow-up period.

Correlation  analysis  demonstrated  the  correlations 
between CRP and FFA concentrations (R = 0.53, P = 0.04 for 
the  nondiabetic patients; R = 0.41, P = 0.03 for the diabetic

P = 0.03 for the nondiabetic patients; R = 0.38, P = 0.027 for 
the diabetic patients). The diabetic MI patients had a positive 
correlation between CRP and PAI-1 concentrations (R = 0.5, 
P = 0.0027) and a negative one with QUICKI (R = –0.33, 
P  =  0.039). A  correlation  between  basal  glucose  and  IL-6

correlations  between  CRP  and  postprandial  glucose  levels 
were found (R = 0.48, P = 0.045 for the nondiabetic patients; 
R = 0.51, P = 0.041 for the diabetic patients) (Figure 3).

In both groups, there were positive correlations between 
IL-6 and FFA concentrations (R = 0.12, P = 0.01; R = 0.49, 
P  =  0.005),  IL-6  and  PAI-1  concentrations  (R  =  0.47, 
P = 0.04; R = 0.54, P = 0.03) (Figure 4), IL-6 levels and CK 
MB activity (R = 0.38, P = 0.01; R = 0.56, P = 0.001) (Fig-
ure 5), and CRP concentrations and IL-6 levels (R = 0.29, 
P = 0.04; R = 0.38, P = 0.03) (Figure 6).

Discussion
According to the contemporary understanding, IR has been 
traditionally regarded as the key stage of T2DM  pathogenesis 
as  well  as  a  risk  factor  for  atherosclerosis  and  MI.15 The 
 well-established  IR  markers  are  glucose,  insulin,  and 
C- peptide  concentrations;  however,  according  to  medical 
literature, postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels are more 
informative than basal (fasting) ones, particularly when there 
are no obvious IR signs.16 This study shows that IR develops 
in MI patients, which is reflected by basal and postprandial 
hyperglycemia both in the acute and early recovery phases irre-
spective of T2DM presence. Indeed, the study demonstrated 
that both diabetic and nondiabetic patients had significantly 
increased glucose levels, while basal insulin concentrations 
did not differ significantly; however, there was a significant 
1.7-fold increase in postprandial insulin levels compared to 
those in the control groups, and the medical literature confirms 
that this parameter is a marker of IR. IR was also confirmed 
by lower QUICKI values. Diabetic MI patients had severe IR, 
and those without T2DM had moderate IR.

Among  other  IR  factors  in  MI,  such  proinflammatory 
cytokines and acute-phase proteins as IL-6 and CRP have been 
extensively studied in the medical literature.3 Recent research 
has shown that IL-6 has autocrine and paracrine properties 
along with its proinflammatory and cardiodepressive effects, 
and might be involved in IR development in MI patients.17 
A large prospective trial in 7735 nondiabetic males with no 
prediabetic conditions, conducted in the UK between 1978 and 
2005, showed a strong association between higher IL-6 levels 
and a risk of T2DM, irrespective of age and obesity.18

Some  authors  suggest  that  molecular  mechanisms 
of  mediated  IL-6  resistance  to  insulin  might  include  the 
 activation of proinflammatory serine/threonine stress kinases, 
protein  suppressors  of  cytokine  signaling,  and  protein 
tyrosine phosphatases acting as physiologic negative regula-
tors of insulin.2

IL-6 was also shown to increase FFA levels in the blood 
of male volunteers, which could induce resistance to periph-
eral tissue insulin. IL-6 is supposed to inhibit the activity of 
lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes, and on the contrary activate 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate-dependent  hormone-
 sensitive lipase in hepatocytes, which contributes to impaired 
circulating lipoprotein metabolism and FFA buildup inducing 
insulin-receptor dysfunction and IR development.15,19

The results of this study demonstrate higher IL-6 and FFA 
levels in the acute phase of MI and their further decrease in 
the early recovery period. Additionally, at day 1, the diabetic 
MI patients had the highest IL-6 and FFA concentrations, 
which could have been associated with profound metabolic 
changes  due  to  more  pronounced  IR  in  this  category  of

patients. The increased production of inflammation mediators 
seems to contribute to lipolysis activation accompanied by 
excess FFA release into the blood flow. The observed  positive 
correlation  between  IL-6  and  FFA  levels  confirms  this 
 suggestion. Reaching the liver, FFA on one hand becomes a 
substrate for triglyceride and atherogenic lipoprotein produc-
tion, and on the other hand causes the buildup of other lipid 
metabolites (ceramides, diacylglycerides), inducing impaired 
insulin signaling and thereby contributing to IR development 
to a much greater extent.16

According to reports of other authors, IL-6 is produced 
by different immune-system and adipose-tissue cells, as well 
as  endothelial  and  epithelial  cells.18  Experimental  studies 
showed that in MI, the main source of this cytokine is cardio-
myocytes, activated macrophages, and T-lymphocytes being 
attracted  to  the  ischemic  region  of  necrosis.20   Obviously, 
the increase in IL-6 concentrations demonstrates not only 
higher  cytokine  production  in  the  cells  involved  in  MI

pathogenesis but also reflects the activity of inflammation 
in the affected myocardium. The results of the correlation 
analysis, which showed positive correlations between IL-6 
and cardiospecific markers of myocardial necrosis, support 
this hypothesis.

IL-6 has recently been established to be capable of stimu-
lating PAI-1 in vitro generation in different cells; PAI-1 is not 
only the key component of the fibrinolytic system but also an 
IR marker.11 PAI-1 has recently been found to block insulin 
signaling in adipocytes, and at the same time the exposition 
of  high  insulin-content  adipocytes  was  accompanied  by 
increased PAI-1 concentrations in these cells. In this study, 
we found higher PAI-1 concentrations in both patient groups, 
and T2DM presence determined higher concentrations of this 
marker in the acute MI phase.

Meanwhile,  in  the  early  recovery  phase,  both  patient 
groups had lower PAI-1 concentrations, which demonstrated 
fibrinolytic activity normalization due to the treatment. The 
correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between 
IL-6 and PAI-1 concentrations in MI patients, which con-
firmed the IL-6-inducing impact on the production of this

protein.  Obviously,  in  MI,  excess  PAI-1  not  only  leads  to 
slower  fibrinolysis,  buildup  of  fibrin,  and  its  degradation 
products and thereby to microvascular thromboses but is also 
involved in IR development, which amplifies prothrombotic 
status.3

Along with activated cytokine production, cardiomyocyte 
ischemia and necrosis are accompanied by the production 
of acute-phase proteins, primarily CRP, which is involved 
in the responses aimed at localizing the affected region and 
myocardial remodeling initiation.16 CRP levels are known 
to increase significantly already 6–8 hours after myocardial 
tissue injury, reach their peak within 24–48 hours, and then 
decrease with a circulation half-time of 6 hours.17 This study 
shows higher CRP concentrations in both patient groups in 
the acute and early recovery phases. The presence of T2DM 
determined the highest protein concentrations in MI patients 
during the entire follow-up period, which might be associ-
ated with higher IL-6 concentrations in this patient category. 
Previous research has established IL-6 to be the most signifi-
cant inducer of CRP production. At the same time, experi-
mental studies showed that CRP was capable of inducing 
IR. According to Pravenec et al, transgenic rats expressing 
human CRP in high concentrations had metabolic disorders 
(hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and glycogen-production 
impairment stimulated by insulin in the skeletal muscles), 
which are intrinsic to IR syndrome.21 D’Alessandris et al 
established that CRP induces serine phosphorylation in the 
insulin-receptor  domain,  which  impairs  the  ability  of  the 
latter to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and leads to 
IR development in rat myocytes.22 Meanwhile, we discovered 
positive correlations between CRP levels and the activity 
of CK MB fraction. The observed correlative associations 
between CRP and metabolic IR markers demonstrate that 
IL-6  is  not  only  the  key  inflammation  mediator  but  also 
plays an active role in FFA and glucose metabolism, and 
fibrinolytic system protein production and secretion, which 
can be involved in pathogenetic events associated with IR 
in MI.

Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that MI as well as acti-
vated inflammation is accompanied by IR development. The 
most informative indicators of impaired sensitivity to insulin 
in MI are increases in FFA and PAI-1 levels compared to 
postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The observed strong 
associations  between  IL-6,  CRP,  basal  and  postprandial 
glycemia, and insulinemia, as well as FFA and PAI-1 levels 
evidence the involvement of nonspecific inflammation factors

in IR development and the amplification of prothrombogenic 
potential in MI patients.

In turn, the presence of preexisting IR determines higher 
thrombogenic status and increases the risk of not only pri-
mary but also recurrent cardiovascular events. The observed 
consistent patterns can lead to new treatment strategies to 
prevent T2DM in MI patients and improve quality of life.
