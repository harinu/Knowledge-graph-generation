ABSTRACT

Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that can be triggered 
by a variety of factors, including pathogens, damaged cells and toxic compounds. 
These  factors  may  induce  acute  and/or  chronic  inflammatory  responses  in  the 
heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, intestinal tract and reproductive system, 
potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. Both infectious and non-infectious 
agents and cell damage activate inflammatory cells and trigger inflammatory signaling 
pathways, most commonly the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. Here, we review 
inflammatory responses within organs, focusing on the etiology of inflammation, 
inflammatory response mechanisms, resolution of inflammation, and organ-specific 
inflammatory responses.

INTRODUCTION

Inflammation is the immune system’s response to 
harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic 
compounds,  or  irradiation  [1],  and  acts  by  removing 
injurious  stimuli  and  initiating  the  healing  process  [2]. 
Inflammation  is  therefore  a  defense  mechanism  that  is 
vital  to  health  [3].  Usually,  during  acute  inflammatory 
responses, cellular and molecular events and interactions 
efficiently minimize impending injury or infection. This 
mitigation  process  contributes  to  restoration  of  tissue 
homeostasis  and  resolution  of  the  acute  inflammation. 
However, uncontrolled acute inflammation may become 
chronic, contributing to a variety of chronic inflammatory 
diseases [4].

At  the  tissue  level,  inflammation  is  characterized 
by  redness,  swelling,  heat,  pain,  and  loss  of  tissue 
function, which result from local immune, vascular and 
inflammatory  cell  responses  to  infection  or  injury  [5]. 
Important microcirculatory events that occur during the 
inflammatory  process  include  vascular  permeability 
changes,  leukocyte  recruitment  and  accumulation,  and 
inflammatory mediator release [2, 6].

Various pathogenic factors, such as infection, tissue 
injury, or cardiac infarction, can induce inflammation by 
causing  tissue  damage.  The  etiologies  of  inflammation 
can be infectious or non-infectious (Table 1). In response 
to  tissue  injury,  the  body  initiates  a  chemical  signaling 
cascade that stimulates responses aimed at healing affected 
tissues. These signals activate leukocyte chemotaxis from 
the general circulation to sites of damage. These activated 
leukocytes produce cytokines that induce inflammatory 
responses [7].

Infectious factors

share a common mechanism, which can be summarized 
as  follows:  1)  cell  surface  pattern  receptors  recognize 
detrimental  stimuli;  2)  inflammatory  pathways  are 
activated; 3) inflammatory markers are released; and 4) 
inflammatory cells are recruited.

Pattern recognition receptor activation

Microbial structures known as pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) can trigger the inflammatory 
response 
through  activation  of  germline-encoded 
pattern-recognition  receptors  (PRRs)  expressed  in  both 
immune  and  nonimmune  cells  [10,  11].  Some  PRRs 
also  recognize  various  endogenous  signals  activated 
during tissue or cell damage and are known as danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) [11]. DAMPs are 
host biomolecules that can initiate and perpetuate a non-
infectious inflammatory response [12]. Disrupted cells can 
also recruit innate inflammatory cells in the absence of 
pathogens by releasing DAMPs [13]. 

Classes  of  PRR  families  include  the  Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic 
acid-inducible  gene  (RIG)-I-like  receptors  (RLRs),  and 
NOD-like  receptors  (NLRs)  [5].  TLRs  are  a  family  of 
highly  conserved,  mammalian  PRRs  that  participate  in 
the activation of the inflammatory response [14]. More 
than ten members of the TLR family have been identified, 
and TLRs are the most well-studied of the known PRRs 
[15]. Transmission of PAMPs and DAMPs is mediated 
by myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) along with 
TLRs. Signaling through TLRs activates an intracellular 
signaling  cascade  [16,  17]  that  leads  to  nuclear 
translocation  of  transcription  factors,  such  as  activator 
protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB or interferon regulatory factor 
3 (IRF3) (Figure 1). DAMPs and PAMPs share receptors, 
such as TLR4, suggesting similarities between infectious 
and noninfectious inflammatory responses [18, 19].

Activation of inflammatory pathways

Inflammatory  pathways  impact  the  pathogenesis 
of  a  number  of  chronic  diseases,  and  involve  common 
inflammatory  mediators  and  regulatory  pathways. 
Inflammatory  stimuli  activate  intracellular  signaling 
pathways that then activate production of inflammatory 

mediators.  Primary  inflammatory  stimuli,  including 
microbial products and cytokines such as interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), mediate inflammation through interaction with 
the TLRs, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), 
and the TNF receptor (TNFR) [20]. Receptor activation 
triggers  important  intracellular  signaling  pathways, 
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and Janus kinase (JAK)-
signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT) 
pathways [21–23].

NF-κB pathway

The  NF-κB  transcription  factor  plays  important 
roles  in  inflammatory,  immune  response,  survival,  and 
apoptosis  processes  [24].  The  NF-κB  family  includes 
five related transcription factors: P50, p52, RelA (p65), 
RelB, and c-Rel [25, 26]. NF-κB activity is induced by a 
range of stimuli, including pathogen-derived substances, 
intercellular inflammatory cytokines, and many enzymes 
[27,  28].  Under  physiological  conditions,  IκB  proteins 
present in the cytoplasm inhibit NF-κB [29]. PRRs use 
similar  signal  transduction  mechanisms  to  activate  IκB 
kinase (IKK), which is composed of two kinase subunits, 
IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, such as IKKγ. 
IKK  regulates  NF-κB  pathway  activation  through  IκB 
phosphorylation  [8].  IκB  phosphorylation  results  in  its 
degradation by the proteasome and the subsequent release 
of NF-κB for nuclear translocation and gene transcription 
activation [30]. This pathway regulates pro-inflammatory 
cytokine production and inflammatory cell recruitment, 
which contribute to the inflammatory response (Figure 2).

MAPK pathway

MAPKs  are  a  family  of  serine/threonine  protein 
kinases  that  direct  cellular  responses  to  a  variety  of 
stimuli,  including  osmotic  stress,  mitogens,  heat  shock, 
and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-
6),  which  regulate  cell  proliferation,  differentiation,  cell 
survival and apoptosis [31, 32]. The mammalian MAPKs 
include  extracellular-signal-regulated  kinase  ERK1/2, 
p38  MAP  Kinase,  and  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinases  (JNK) 
[33].  Each  MAPK  signaling  pathway  comprises  at  least 

7205

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetthree components: a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), 
and  a  MAPK  kinase  kinase  (MAPKKK).  MAPKKKs 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs  [33,  34].  ERKs  are 
generally activated by mitogens and differentiation signals, 

while  inflammatory  stimuli  and  stress  activate  JNK  and 
p38 [35]. MKK1 and MKK2 activate ERK1/2, MKK4 and 
MKK7 activate JNK, and MKK3 and MKK6 activate p38. 
Activation of the MAPKs, including Erk1/2, JNK, leads to 
phosphorylation and activation of p38 transcription factorsv  

Figure 1: TLR signaling. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways are shown. Signaling through TLRs activates intracellular 
signaling cascades that lead to nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB or IRF3, which regulates the inflammatory response.

Figure 2: NF-κB pathway. This pathway is triggered by TLRs and inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, leading to activation 
of  RelA/p50  complexes  that  regulate  expression  of  inflammatory  cytokines.  NF-κB  signaling  requires  IKK  subunits.  which  regulate 
pathway activation through IκB phosphorylation.

7206

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetpresent  in  the  cytoplasm  or  nucleus,  which  initiates  the 
inflammatory response [32, 36] (Figure 3).

JAK-STAT pathway

The  highly  conserved  JAK-STAT  pathway  involves 
diverse  cytokines,  growth  factors,  interferons,  and  related 
molecules,  such  as  leptin  and  growth  hormone,  and  is  a 
signaling mechanism through which extracellular factors can 
control  gene  expression  [37].  Receptor-associated  JAKs  are 
activated  by  ligands  and  phosphorylate  one  other,  creating 
docking  sites  for  STATs,  which  are  latent,  cytoplasmic 
transcription factors. Cytoplasmic STATs recruited to these sites 
undergo phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization before 
translocation  to  the  nucleus  [38].  Tyrosine  phosphorylation 
is  essential  for  STAT  dimerization  and  DNA  binding  [39]. 
Therefore, JAK/STAT signaling allows for the direct translation 
of an extracellular signal into a transcriptional response. For 
example, binding of IL-6 family members to plasma membrane 
receptors  activates  the  JAK-STAT  proteins.  STAT  proteins 
translocated into the nucleus bind target gene promoter regions 
to regulate transcription of inflammatory genes (Figure 4) [40].

Dysregulation  of  NF-κB,  MAPK,  or  JAK-STAT 
activity  is  associated  with  inflammatory,  autoimmune, 
and metabolic diseases, and cancer [41]. Signaling through 
transcription factors results in secretion of cytokines [42, 
43].  Multiple  transcription  factors  regulate  a  variety  of 
inflammatory  genes,  such  as  IL-1,  TNF-α,  IL-6  [44], 
colony stimulating factor (CSF), interferons, transforming 
growth factor (TGF), and chemokines.

Inflammatory markers

Markers are used in clinical applications to indicate 
normal versus pathogenic biological processes, and assess 
responses  to  therapeutic  interventions.  Inflammatory 
markers  may  be  predictive  of  inflammatory  diseases 
[45–50], and correlate with the causes and consequences 
of various inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular 
diseases, endothelial dysfunctions, and infection [51, 52]. 
Stimuli activate inflammatory cells, such as macrophages 
and adipocytes, and induce production of inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and inflammatory 
proteins  and  enzymes. These  molecules  can  potentially 
serve as biomarkers for diseases diagnosis, prognosis, and 
therapeutic decision making [53–57].

Inflammatory cytokines

Cytokines  (Table  2)  are  predominantly  released 
from immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, 
and lymphocytes. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines 
respectively. 
facilitate  and 
Inflammatory  cytokines  are  classified  as  ILs,  colony 
stimulating  factors  (CSF),  IFNs,  TNFs,  TGFs,  and 
chemokines,  and  are  produced  by  cells  primarily  to 

inflammation, 

inhibit 

recruit leukocytes to the site of infection or injury [58]. 
Cytokines  modulate  the  immune  response  to  infection 
or  inflammation  and  regulate  inflammation  itself  via  a 
complex  network  of  interactions.  However,  excessive 
inflammatory  cytokine  production  can  lead  to  tissue 
damage,  hemodynamic  changes,  organ  failure,  and 
ultimately death [59, 60]. A better understanding of how to 
regulate cytokine pathways would allow for more accurate 
identification  of  agent-mediated  inflammation  and  the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases [58].

Inflammatory proteins and enzymes

Inflammatory  proteins  in  the  blood,  including 
C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  haptoglobin,  serum  amyloid 
A,  fibrinogen,  and  alpha  1-acid  glycoprotein  [61], 
help  restore  homeostasis  and  reduce  microbial  growth 
independently  of  antibodies  during  trauma,  stress,  or 
infection [62]. Abnormal activation of certain enzymes, 
including  high-mobility  group  box  1  (HMGB1), 
superoxide  dismutase  (SOD),  glutathione  peroxidase 
(GPx),  NADPH  oxidase  (NOX),  inducible  nitric  oxide 
synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, play key 
roles in the development of inflammation-related diseases, 
such as cardiovascular disease and cancer [63–66]. For 
example, extracellular HMGB1 effects may be mediated 
by  activation  of TLR-coupled  signaling  pathways  [67]. 
The primary target of extracellular HMGB1 is TLR4 [68], 
which triggers MyD88-dependent intracellular signaling 
cascades involved in activation of the NF-κB and MAPK 
pathways.  This  leads  to  release  of  such  inflammatory 
cytokines as TNF-α and IL-1β [67]. Inflammatory proteins 
and enzymes have been used as inflammation, infection, 
and trauma biomarkers in medicine.

Other inflammatory markers

(MDA), 

Antioxidant defense systems, including antioxidant 
enzymes, influence oxidative stress. Elevated oxidative 
stress can induce production of reactive oxygen species 
8-Hydroxy-2-
(ROS),  malondialdehyde 
deoxyguanosine  (8-OHdG)  and  isoprostanes  [64,  69], 
each of which can activate various transcription factors, 
including NF-κB, AP-1, p53, and STAT. Thus, this cascade 
can increase expression of genes encoding growth factors, 
inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [70]. Oxidative 
stress  is  associated  with  the  pathogenesis  of  multiple 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, 
hypertension,  aging,  and  atherosclerosis.  Therefore, 
oxidative stress products can also be used as markers of 
the inflammatory response.

coordinated  network  of  many  cell  types.  Activated

macrophages, monocytes, and other cells mediate local 
responses  to  tissue  damage  and  infection.  At  sites  of 
tissue  injury,  damaged  epithelial  and  endothelial  cells 
release  factors  that  trigger  the  inflammatory  cascade, 
along with chemokines and growth factors, which attract 
neutrophils and monocytes. The first cells attracted to a 
site  of  injury  are  neutrophils,  followed  by  monocytes, 
lymphocytes (natural killer cells [NK cells], T cells, and B 
cells), and mast cells [71–73]. Monocytes can differentiate 
into macrophages and dendritic cells and are recruited via 

7208

chemotaxis into damaged tissues. Inflammation-mediated 
immune  cell  alterations  are  associated  with  many 
diseases, including asthma, cancer, chronic inflammatory 
diseases, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and autoimmune and 
degenerative diseases.

Neutrophils,  which 

target  microorganisms 

in 
the  body,  can  also  damage  host  cells  and  tissues  [74]. 
Neutrophils  are  key  mediators  of  the  inflammatory 
response, and program antigen presenting cells to activate T 
cells and release localized factors to attract monocytes and 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetdendritic cells [7]. Macrophages are important components 
of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and are critical in 
inflammation initiation, maintenance, and resolution [75]. 
During  inflammation,  macrophages  present  antigens, 
undergo phagocytosis, and modulate the immune response 
by  producing  cytokines  and  growth  factors.  Mast  cells, 
which reside in connective tissue matrices and on epithelial 
surfaces,  are  effector  cells  that  initiate  inflammatory 
responses.  Activated  mast  cell  release  a  variety  of 
inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, 
histamine,  proteases,  prostaglandins,  leukotrienes,  and 
serglycin proteoglycans [76].

Multiple  groups  have  demonstrated  that  platelets 
impact  inflammatory  processes,  from  atherosclerosis 
to  infection.  Platelet  interactions  with  inflammatory 
cells  may  mediate  pro-inflammatory  outcomes.  The 
acute  phase  response  (APR)  is  the  earliest  response  to 
infection or injury, and some studies have indicated that 
platelets induce the APR [77]. After being recruited by 
inflammatory stimuli, immune cells amplify and sustain 
the APR by releasing local inflammatory mediators at the 
site of recruitment.

RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION

To  prevent  progression  from  acute  inflammation  to 
persistent,  chronic  inflammation,  the  inflammatory  response 
must  be  suppressed  to  prevent  additional  tissue  damage. 
Inflammation resolution is a well-managed process involving 
the spatially- and temporally-controlled production of mediators, 
during  which  chemokine  gradients  are  diluted  over  time. 

Circulating white blood cells eventually no longer sense these 
gradients and are not recruited to sites of injury. Dysregulation of 
this process can lead to uncontrolled chronic inflammation [78]. 
Inflammation resolution processes that rectify tissue homeostasis 
include reduction or cessation of tissue infiltration by neutrophils 
and  apoptosis  of  spent  neutrophils,  counter-regulation  of 
chemokines and cytokines, macrophage transformation from 
classically  to  alternatively  activated  cells,  and  initiation  of 
healing [79, 80].
Chronic 

inflammation  occurs  when 
to  eliminate 

acute 
inflammatory  mechanisms  fail 
tissue 
injury [81], and may lead to a host of diseases, such as 
cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers [82]. Understanding the 
common mechanisms that orchestrate dysfunction in the 
various  organ  systems  will  allow  for  development  and 
production of improved targeted therapies.

ORGAN-SPECIFIC 
RESPONSES

INFLAMMATORY 

Inflammation  has  long  been  recognized  as  a 
major  cause  of  disease.  It  is  estimated  that  some  15% 
of human cancers are associated with chronic infection 
and inflammation [83]. Acute and chronic inflammation-
mediated tissue injury is observed in many organ systems, 
including the heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, 
intestinal tract, and reproductive system.

Figure 3: MAPK pathway. This pathway mediates intracellular signaling initiated by extracellular stimuli, such as stress and cytokines. 
MAPKKKs  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs.  The  mammalian  MAPK  family 
includes Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. In the Erk1/2 pathway, Erk1/2 is activated by MKK1/2, which is activated by Raf. In the JNK pathway, 
JNK is activated by MKK4/7, which is activated by MEKK1/4, ASK1, and MLK3. In the p38 pathway, p38 is activated by MKK3/6, 
which is activated by MLK3, TAK, and DLK. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate various proteins, including transcription factors, resulting 
in regulation of inflammatory responses.

Cardiovascular disease, and its underlying pathology, 
atherosclerosis, is the major cause of death and disability 
worldwide [84, 85]. By 2030, almost 23.6 million people 
are projected to die annually from cardiovascular disorders 
[86,  87].  Inflammatory  mediators  play  key  roles  in 
atherosclerosis, from initial leukocyte recruitment through 
rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque [88–91]. Inflammation 
is also an early event in cardiac stress. Elevated levels of 
endothelial adhesion molecules and increased inflammatory 
cytokine  and  chemokine  production  and  release  are 
observed in affected cardiac tissues [92].

The innate immune system is the primary cardiac 
defense  against  pathogens  and  tissue  damage  [93]. 
Myocardial  infarction,  which  commonly  results  from 
coronary atherosclerosis and involves acute loss of many 
myocardial cells, is the most common cause of cardiac 
injury [94]. Necrotic cardiac cells initiate an inflammatory 
cascade  to  clear  dead  cells  and  debris  from  the  infarct 
[95,  96].  Cell  death  releases  intracellular  components 
that  activate  innate  immune  mechanisms  to  initiate  an 
inflammatory  response.  Endogenous  ligands  released 
following  injury  are  recognized  as  danger  signals  by 
cell  surface  receptors,  and  activate  inflammation  [97, 
98].  TLR-mediated  pathways  trigger  post-infarction 
inflammatory  responses  by  activating  NF-κB  signaling 
[98–103]. Chemokines recruit inflammatory leukocytes to 
the infarct, and cytokines promote leukocyte-endothelial 
cell  adhesions  [104,  105].  Moreover, TGF-β  and  IL-10 
promote  cardiac  repair  by  suppressing  inflammation, 
enhancing  myofibroblast  phenotypic  modulation,  and 
promoting extracellular matrix deposition [106, 107].

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death 
and disability in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially 
those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), in whom cardiovascular 
disease occurs 14.6 years earlier on average [108]. About 
two-thirds  of  deaths  in  people  with  diabetes  are  due  to 

cardiovascular disease; among these, approximately 40% 
die from ischemic heart disease, 15% from other forms 
of heart disease, principally congestive heart failure, and 
about  10%  from  stroke  [109].  Recent  global  estimates 
indicate that over 422 million adults currently live with 
diabetes, of which over 90% have T2D.

Diabetes 

is  a  group  of  metabolic  disorders 
characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels, and is 
a major global health challenge, both to individuals and 
their families, and to healthcare systems [110]. Diabetes 
complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, 
limb amputation, blindness, and nerve damage. Diabetes 
results  from  either  impaired  insulin  production  in  the 
pancreas or body cells not responding to produced insulin 
[111]. Insulin resistance is defined as decreased insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake, and is associated with inactivity, 
obesity, and aging. Pancreatic islet cells respond to insulin 
resistance by enhancing insulin secretion and cell mass. 
However, when islet β-cells are unable to compensate for 
insulin resistance, insulin deficiency develops, followed by 
T2D [112], which is increasingly being characterized as 
an inflammatory disease [113, 114]. Elevated circulating 
levels of acute-phase proteins, including CRP, fibrinogen, 
serum  amyloid  A,  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor, 
and  haptoglobin,  along  with  sialic  acid,  cytokines,  and 
chemokines,  have  been  observed  in  patients  with  T2D. 
Elevated  IL-1β,  IL-6,  TNF-α,  and  CRP  levels  are  also 
predictive of T2D. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is 
elevated  in  obesity  and  prediabetes  prior  to T2D  onset. 
Excessive nutrient levels, including those of glucose and 
free  fatty  acids,  promote  insulin  resistance.  T2D  also 
activates the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways, 
which can each promote tissue inflammation [110, 114, 
115]. Metabolic stressors also negatively impact pancreatic 
islet cells and insulin-sensitive tissues, including adipose 
tissue, promoting local cytokine and chemokine production 
and release. At the same time, immune cells, such as mast 
cells  and  macrophages,  are  recruited  and  contribute  to 

Figure 4: JAK-STAT pathway. Following IL-6 binding, signal is transduced by a receptor to activate the JAKs, which then activate 
STATs. STATs are dephosphorylated in the nucleus, leading to activation of downstream cytokines.

release from adipose tissues into the circulation promotes 
further inflammation in other tissues [116].    

Pancreas

by 

caused 

pancreatic 

Pancreatitis, 

duct 
obstruction,  trypsinogen  gene  mutation,  or  alcoholism, 
is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas [117]. Acute 
pancreatitis (AP) incidence ranges from 4–45 per 100,000 
patients per year and increases annually by approximately 
1.3–4.0% in most developed countries. AP is one of the 
most common gastrointestinal causes for hospitalization in 
the US, and chronic pancreatitis (CP) is less common than 
AP. However, CP patients experience chronic abdominal 
insufficiency, 
pain  and  exocrine  and/or  endocrine 
leading  to  reduced  quality  of  life  [118].  Pancreatitis  is 
characterized by acinar cell destruction and activation of 
inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, 
and granulocytes, which secrete inflammatory cytokines 
[117,  119].  These  cytokines  further  activate  pancreatic 
stellate  cells  (PSCs)  to  promote  CP  [120].  Pancreatitis 
development requires various molecular pathways, such as 
NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT, which play critical roles 
in inflammatory cell activation during pancreatitis [117]. 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal 
of malignancies and a major health burden [121], and is the 
fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the US 
[118]. There is a strong link between antecedent CP and PC 
[122]. CP leads to fibrosis, which is a common pathological 
feature and major risk factor for PC [123]. Pancreatic cancer 
results from dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes, as well as growth factors and their receptors, including 
epidermal growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and many cytokines, 
such as TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, which modulate 
pathways involved in growth and differentiation [124, 125]. 
Shi,  et  al.  has  showed  that  VEGF  is  upregulated  by  low 
extracellular PH (acidosis), which occurs frequently around 
necrotic regions in tumors, and that acidosis activates IL-8 
[126]. VEGF and IL-8 are important angiogenic factors in 
PC [126], and acidosis-promoted upregulation of these genes 
can be mediated through NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation and 
cooperation [127]. 

Liver

Inflammation  in  the  liver  protects  this  organ  from 
infection and injury, but excessive inflammation may lead 
to  extensive  loss  of  hepatocytes,  ischemia-reperfusion 
injury,  metabolic  alterations,  and  eventually  permanent 
hepatic  damage  [128].  Inflammation  can  destroy  hepatic 
parenchymal  cells,  increasing  the  risk  of  chronic  liver 
diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver diseases are a leading cause 
of morbidity and mortality in the US [129].

7211

The  liver  is  the  largest  solid  organ  in  the  body 
[130], and is a target of both infectious and non-infectious 
inflammatory  pathologies.  Infectious  inflammation  of 
the  liver  is  mainly  caused  by  microorganisms,  such  as 
bacterial  products,  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV),  or  hepatitis 
C  virus  (HCV)  [131,  132].  Sterile  inflammation  (SI)  is 
also  important  in  the  pathology  of  many  liver  diseases, 
such  as  alcoholic  or  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis,  drug-
induced liver injury, and ischemia/reperfusion [133–135]. 
In SI, endogenous DAMPs are released to injured tissues 
and  activate  immune  cells  [136]. While  pathogen-driven 
inflammation and SI differ, they share several functional 
characteristics.  Many  receptors  and  pathways  can  be 
activated by both PAMPs and DAMPs [137]. TLR4, for 
example,  can  be  activated  by  bacterial  LPS  and  cellular 
HMGB1.  Because  of  the  liver’s  unique  vascular  supply, 
PAMPs of intestinal origin and DAMPs from hepatocytes 
both contribute to inflammation in a variety of diseases. For 
example, PRR activation by DAMPs and PAMPs can induce 
production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  immune 
cell localization to sites of injury. Recognition of DAMPs 
and  PAMPs  results  in  assembly  of  the  inflammasome,  a 
cytosolic protein complex that activates the serine protease 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β and 
other cytokines. At the same time, Kupffer cell activation 
and  inflammatory  cell  recruitment  leads  to  production 
of  cytokines  and  chemokines  that  promote  long-term 
inflammation, hepatocyte damage, and/or cholestasis [138].

Lung

Lung  inflammatory  diseases  involve  complex 
interactions  among  and  between  structural  and  immune 
cells  [139].  Lung  inflammation  results  predominantly 
from tissue exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens, and/
or environmental pollutants. Excessive acute inflammation 
and subsequent lung injury can cause pulmonary fibrosis 
and  impair  gas  exchange.  Unresolved  lung  injury  and 
chronic  inflammation  are  frequently  observed  in  acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome,  cystic  fibrosis,  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma [140–
142]. Approximately 90% of COPD cases are associated 
with  cigarette  smoking-induced  inflammation  in  small 
airways and lung parenchyma [143]. Cigarette smoking is a 
major risk factor for COPD, which involves both systemic 
and  pulmonary  inflammation.  Long-term  smoking  can 
cause macrophage, neutrophil, and activated T lymphocyte 
infiltration  into  airways,  and  promote  production  of 
chemokines,  oxygen  radicals,  proteases,  and  cytokines, 
including that of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, in the lung [144].

Kidney

Kidney inflammation contributes to progressive renal 
injury,  which  may  lead  to  glomerulonephritis,  end-stage 
renal  disease,  or  acute  or  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD) 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget[145–147]. Approximately 10–12% of the population suffers 
from CKD, and some 50% of elderly patients show signs of 
kidney dysfunction, which is associated with high morbidity 
and mortality [52]. Kidney inflammation is most commonly 
induced by infection, ischemia/reperfusion, in situ immune-
complex  formation/deposition,  or  complement  pathway 
dysregulation [145]. CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI) 
are the most severe types of kidney disease [148]. Interstitial 
inflammation  and  tubular  injury  are  commonly  observed 
in  acute  and  chronic  kidney  injury  cases.  Renal  tubular 
epithelial  cells  are  likely  important  promoters  of  kidney 
inflammation, secreting a variety of inflammatory cytokines 
in response to both immune and non-immune factors, and 
leukocyte  infiltration  depends  on  the  local  presence  of 
these cytokines [146]. Stimuli that can induce kidney injury 
activate  transcription  factors  (NF-κB  or  MAPK).  These 
stimuli  include  cytokines,  growth  factors,  DAMPs,  and 
PAMPs, TLRs, Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and metabolic 
(high glucose, advanced glycosylation end products) and 
immune mediators [147].

Intestinal tract

Acute  and  chronic  inflammatory  diseases  of  the 
intestine  can  cause  various  health  issues,  and  decrease 
patient quality of life worldwide [149, 150]. The complex, 
polygenetic  inflammatory  bowel  diseases  (IBDs)  are 
characterized by an excessive inflammatory response to 
gut  lumen  microbial  flora  [151].  IBDs  mainly  include 
ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  and  Crohn  disease  (CD),  but 
also  noninfectious  inflammation  of  the  bowel  [152, 
153]. Idiopathic IBDs, such as CD and UC, are caused 
by  cytokine-driven,  non-infectious  inflammation  of 
the  gut.  For  example,  CD  is  associated  with  excessive 
IFN-γ/IL-17  and  IL-12/IL-23  production,  while  UC  is 
associated with excess IL-13 [153]. Thus, IBD appears to 
be the result of a dysfunctional interaction between gut 
bacteria  and  the  mucosal  immune  system  [154]. A  key 
process in the immune system’s response to microbes is 
the recognition of microbial agents via PRRs, including 
TLRs  and  nucleotide-binding  oligomerization  domain 
containing NLRs, which sense evolutionarily conserved 
PAMPs  [155].  Upon  PAMP  detection,  PRRs  activate 
intracellular signaling pathways that induce production of 
cytokines and chemokines to promote host resistance to 
infection. TLR (mainly TLR4) signaling induces NF-κB 
and MAPK transcription. At the same time, NLRs are also 
activated through ligand detection [154], in turn activating 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β, 
interleukin-18 and other cytokines [154].

Reproductive system

ovulation,  and  parturition  trigger  the  inflammatory 
cascade.  However, 
initiation  and  maintenance  of 
inflammatory  processes  are  also  important  components 
of  many  reproductive  tract  diseases.  Damaged  tissues 
locally release inflammatory interleukins, growth factors, 
cytokines,  and  prostaglandins,  which  activate  signaling 
pathways  and  recruit  immune  cells  (e.g.  neutrophils 
and  macrophages)  to  the  site  of  injury.  This  process 
synergistically controls tissue remodeling and repair, but 
can also induce inflammatory diseases [7]. Inflammatory 
cytokines, including IL-6, are the primary mediators of 
inflammation-related  reproductive  tract  diseases,  and 
act via signal transduction pathways such as the MAPK 
pathway [157, 158].

Brain

Inflammatory  responses  occur  in  the  brain  in 
many  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  diseases,  including 
autoimmune  diseases,  neurodegenerative  diseases  like 
Alzheimer’s  (AD)  and  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD),  and 
epilepsy. Inflammatory responses in the brain can enhance 
neuronal  excitability,  injure  cells,  and  increase  blood-
brain  barrier  permeability  to  various  molecules  [159–
161].  Inflammation-associated  CNS  diseases  result  from 
activation of the brain’s resident immune cells and microglia, 
which  produce  pro-inflammatory  markers  [162].  These 
inflammation  processes  also  involve  both  the  innate  and 
adaptive immune systems and resemble immune responses 
to  systemic  infection.  Cytokines  and  TLRs  are  major 
inflammatory  mediators  in  the  transition  between  innate 
and adaptive. Inflammatory responses in the CNS may also 
be triggered by endogenous ligands recognized by TLRs. 
DAMPs,  such  as  heat-shock  proteins  and  extracellular 
matrix degradation molecules, entering the brain through 
a damaged blood-brain barrier may initiate inflammatory 
responses.  The  CNS  inflammatory  response  is  strong  in 
reaction to both infectious agents and brain injury, such as 
tissue damage observed following ischemic, traumatic, or 
excitotoxic brain injury, or seizure [160, 163, 164].

CONCLUSIONS

Inflammation  is  frequently  a  key  element  in  the 
pathological  progression  of  organ  disease.  Three  main 
pathways,  NF-κB,  MAPK,  and  JAK-STAT,  play  major 
roles in inflammation, and dysregulation of one or more 
of these pathways may lead to inflammation-associated 
disease. A better understanding of inflammatory response 
pathways  and  molecular  mechanisms  will  undoubtedly 
contribute  to  improved  prevention  and  treatment  of 
inflammatory diseases.

The  hallmarks  of  inflammation  are  observed 
during  many  normal  reproductive  processes,  including 
menstruation,  ovulation,  implantation,  and  parturition 
[156].  Injury  and  healing  caused  by  menstruation,
