Purpose: Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes citrullination, a post-translational
modiﬁcation that can alter structure, function and antigenicity of proteins. Citrullination in
the lungs due to smoking is believed to initiate an anti-citrulline immune response in
rheumatoid arthritis. Citrullination in other inﬂamed organs has also been demonstrated,
but it is not known whether smoking or inﬂammatory processes in general result in release of
relevant amounts of PAD into the circulation with potential to cause citrullination of proteins
at various anatomical sites. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) induces an acute systemic inﬂammation response. In the present study, we
investigate whether smoking or acute systemic inﬂammation causes release of PAD into the
circulation.
Patients and methods: This study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease (16
smokers and 20 non-smokers) undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Circulating levels of
PAD2 and PAD4, PAD activity,
the neutrophil activation markers MPO, MMP-9 and
lipocalin-2, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL8 were measured 2 hrs
preoperatively and 2 hrs postoperatively.
Results: At baseline, serum PAD2 and PAD4 concentration did not differ between smokers
and non-smokers. However, serum from non-smokers contained higher PAD activity than
serum from smokers. Circulating PAD2 levels and PAD activity increased markedly in both
groups after surgery, as did all neutrophil activation markers, cytokines and chemokine.
PAD2 levels correlated with neutrophil activation markers, but not with cytokine and
chemokine levels.
Conclusion: Blood levels of PAD2 did not differ signiﬁcantly between smokers and non-
smokers, but smokers had decreased PAD activity in the circulation. PAD2 levels and
PAD activity increased in blood during inﬂammation induced by CABG with CPB. This
suggests that acute inﬂammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or a combination of these,
leads to systemic spreading of enzymatically active PAD, which may affect protein
function and induce generation of citrullinated self-antigens.

Introduction
Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the post-translational protein modiﬁcation
known as citrullination, which refers to the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline
residues. Citrullination can alter the function of several proteins, including cytokines and
chemokines,1,2 ﬁbrinogen,3 nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase4 and transforming growth

factor-β,5 and induce structural changes in proteins that gen-
erate autoantigenic neoepitopes, as observed in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and type I diabetes.6,7 The human PAD enzyme
family has ﬁve members (PADs 1–4 and 6), of which PAD2
and PAD4 are expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin, eg,
monocytes, lymphocytes and granulocytes.8 Neutrophils are
considered a major source of PAD2 and PAD4,9–11 and PAD
released from neutrophils is capable of citrullinating extracel-
lular proteins.10,12 Prerequisites for PAD activation are a high
calcium concentration, which is found in the extracellular
space,13 and a redox potential that maintains the catalytic site
in a reduced state.10,14 PAD and citrullinated proteins are
abundant in the lungs of smokers and are suspected to be the
initial source of citrullinated proteins that cause the anti-
citrulline immune response involved in RA.15–17 Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease18 and periodontitis19 are other
inﬂammatory conditions associated with
examples of
increased local levels of citrullinated proteins. Indeed, protein
citrullination appears to occur in inﬂammation in general.20
However, it is not known whether inﬂammation leads to
release of PAD into the bloodstream, which may potentially
cause citrullination of proteins in the circulation or at distant
anatomical sites, thereby generating antigens that ignite auto-
immune reactions.

is

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass
an example of
(CPB)
a circumstance where acute systemic inﬂammation occurs,
partly due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after aortic
unclamping leading to activation of endothelial cells and
neutrophils, and partly because neutrophils are activated
after contact with artiﬁcial surfaces of the cannula and
tubing connecting the patient to the CPB system.21–24

We investigate here whether smoking is associated
with increased levels of circulating PAD2 and PAD4, or
with increased PAD activity. Moreover, we examine
whether acute inﬂammation such as that
induced by
CABG surgery can lead to the release of enzymatically
active PAD into the systemic circulation.

Material and methods
Patient selection
The study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease
who underwent conventional elective CABG at
the
Department of Thoracic Surgery, Copenhagen University
Hospital Rigshospitalet. Patients below 18 years of age,
pregnant women, and patients with cancer, autoimmune dis-
orders or chronic inﬂammatory disorders were excluded.

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The smokers
included (n=16) had all smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes
per day for at least 5 years and had smoked in the 48 hrs
before surgery. The non-smokers (n=20) had all smoked
<100 cigarettes ever. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee H-3-2014-164 and was per-
formed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and
all patients gave written informed consent.

antihypertensives

Preoperative medication
All patients had their aspirin and antiplatelet drugs paused
before the surgery. All patients were receiving treatment
antihypercholesterolemic
and
with
agents before the surgery. Patients with type 2 diabetes
were receiving treatment with either insulin or oral anti-
diabetics. One patient was receiving treatment with the
anti-inﬂammatory prednisolone (2.5 mg) before surgery.

Anesthesia
Anesthetic management was standardized. No premedica-
tion was given. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and
propofol infusion. Propofol, sevoﬂuran and remifentanil
were titrated thereafter. Cisatracurium was administered
before tracheal
intubation. Some patients were given
bolus CaCl and noradrenaline when coming off the CPB.
Corticosteroids were not used in any of the patients during
perioperative management. Cefuroxime (1.5 g) and genta-
micin (240 mg) were given perioperatively.

Surgical procedure
All CABG procedures were performed via a median ster-
notomy, and on-pump with CPB and extracorporeal circu-
lation (ECC). Patients were fully heparinized to maintain
an acquired coagulation time above 480 s. This effect was
reversed with protamine sulfate (1:1) after ﬁnalization of
ECC. Cardiac arrest was achieved with cold blood cardi-
oplegia, and ECC was performed under normothermia.
Standard anesthetic techniques were used, and intra-
operative monitoring was in accordance with guidelines.
Standard guidelines for anti-coagulation therapy were
followed.

Serum sampling
Blood samples were drawn 2 hrs before surgery and 2 hrs
after surgery (from the closure of the skin) in 6 mL dry
tubes (VACUETTE, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen,
Germany), from which serum was isolated.

Measurements of serum cytokines,
markers of neutrophil activation and PAD
Serum IL-6, IL-10 and CXCL-8 were measured using the
Cytometric Bead Array Human Inﬂammatory Cytokine Kit
II (Cat. no. 551811) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) after dilution of 5 µL serum in 20 µL PBS
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A FACS
Canto II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for
data acquisition, and the FCAPArray Software (SoftFlow,
Burnsville, MN, USA) was used for analysis. Neutrophil
activation markers were measured in serum diluted 1:50 in
sample diluent following the manufacturer’s instructions
using the Luminex Bio-Plex® 200 system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by means of the one-
plex myeloperodidase (MPO) assay (R&D, Abingdon,
UK), and the two-plex MMP-9 and lipocalin-2/NGAL
(R&D) assay. PAD2 was measured using an in-house PAD2-
speciﬁc assay on a Luminex platform.25 In brief, the murine
monoclonal anti-PAD2 antibody DN2 was coupled to beads,
and patient serum diluted 1:3 in sample buffer was added.
After washing, biotinylated anti-PAD2 antibody DN625 and

PE-labelled streptavidin were used for detection. CV% of
spiked controls were <15%. PAD4 was measured in undi-
luted serum using a commercially available ELISA kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SEF709Hu
[N-terminal version], Cloud-Clone, TX, USA). Ability to
detect PAD4 speciﬁcally was conﬁrmed by spiking of
rhPAD2 or rhPAD4 into serum, but low recovery (<10%)
was observed.

Determination of PAD activity
PAD activity in serum was determined using a previously
of matrix-bound
described
ﬁbrinogen.13 In brief, Nunc ELISA plates (Roskilde,
Denmark) were coated with ﬁbrinogen (1.0 μg/mL). After
three washes, wells were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 mins at room temperature.
Serum was added (50 μL/well) and incubated for 4 hrs at RT,
with or without 1 mM DTT and/or 25 mM EDTA. After three
washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the wells were
incubated for 90 mins with 100 μL of murine anti-
citrullinated ﬁbrinogen antibody (clone 20B2, Modiquest,

with 100 μL of HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-

(Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween. Finally,
the plates were washed three times and developed with
3,3ʹ,5,5ʹ-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped
after 15 mins with H2SO4 at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 M.

Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences
between groups using GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-rank test was used to determine differences
before and after surgery. Spearman’s correlation (Rs)

coefﬁcients and levels of signiﬁcance were determined
using GraphPad Prism. Two-tailed probability values
<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Determination of circulating PAD2 and
PAD4 levels
We observed no signiﬁcant difference in PAD2 or PAD4 levels
between smokers and non-smokers before or after surgery
(Figure 1A, B, D, and E). The circulating PAD2 levels of
nearly all participants increased during surgery; the median
level before surgery was 0.3 ng/mL (10–90 percentile range:
0.1–1 ng/mL) compared to 1.15 ng/mL (0.3–5.12 ng/mL) after
surgery (p<0.0001) (Figure 1C). We found no signiﬁcant

Catalytic activity of circulating PAD
We next tested whether the circulating PAD was enzy-
matically active and observed higher PAD activity in
serum from non-smokers than in serum from smokers
before surgery (Figure 2A), which we did not expect.
This difference was also present after surgery (Figure
2B). Since smoking has been reported to cause oxida-

whether PAD activity could be restored by addition of
DTT, an exogenous
reducing agent. PAD activity
increased in both groups after addition of DTT, but the
activity remained lower in smokers than in non-smokers
(Figure 2C). As illustrated in Figure 2D, CABG surgery
caused a marked increase in catalytic activity of circu-
lating PAD in nearly all patients tested, both for smo-
kers and non-smokers (p<0.001).

Effect of CABG surgery on inﬂammatory
mediators and neutrophil degranulation
To determine whether the increase in PAD2 levels and PAD
activity observed during CABG surgery reﬂected the state
of inﬂammation, we quantiﬁed circulating levels of the pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine IL-6, the anti-inﬂammatory cyto-
kine IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL-8 (Figure 3A–C).
The levels of all three molecules increased after surgery
(Figure 3A–C). To address the degree of neutrophil activa-
tion, we quantiﬁed MPO, MMP-9 and lipocalin-2, as mar-
kers of degranulation of the primary, secondary and tertiary
granules, respectively. The levels of all three markers were
elevated after surgery (Figure 3D–F).

Before surgery, the levels of PAD2 did not correlate
with any of the biomarkers, whereas a signiﬁcant corre-
lation was found between circulating PAD2 and MPO
levels after surgery (p=0.03; Table 2). After surgery, we
observed a trend toward correlation between PAD2 and
the two other markers of neutrophil activation, whereas
no association was observed with IL-6, IL-10 or CXCL-
8. When the basal levels of all six biomarkers before
surgery were subtracted from those observed after sur-
gery (shown as “ΔSurgery” in Table 2), the change in
circulating PAD2 levels correlated with the changes in
both MPO and lipocalin-2 levels, but not with the
change in IL-6,
IL-10 or CXCL-8. No associations
were observed between PAD4 and the six biomarkers
before or after surgery (data not shown).

Figure 2 PAD activity in serum after CABG surgery. ELISA microtiter plates coated
with human ﬁbrinogen were incubated for 4 hrs with sera from 36 patients who had
undergone CABG surgery, either with 1 mM DTT (+DTT) or without additives (no
DTT). As negative control, each serum was tested in the presence of 25 mM EDTA. (A)

Discussion
Citrullination alters the function and antigenicity of
many proteins2,4,27 and is thought
to play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases,
especially RA.7 Citrullination in this respect is thought
to occur at the very sites of PAD release, eg, in the
lungs, periodontal tissue or gut.15,19,28 In this study, we
put forward the hypothesis that PAD is released into the
circulation following smoking or acute inﬂammation.

PAD2 was present in detectable concentrations in the
blood from most patients before surgery, and was found to
be markedly increased after surgery. This was not the case
for PAD4 levels. We have previously found detectable
blood levels of PAD2 in less than a third of normal
blood donors,25 but to our knowledge, no other studies
have examined circulating PAD2 in relation to disease or
inﬂammation. Although smokers tended to have slightly

higher blood levels of PAD2 than non-smokers, there was
a great overlap between our groups. Increased amounts of
PAD2 along with increased numbers of macrophages have
previously been shown in the lungs of smokers.16,17 Our
data indicate that this PAD2 enters the bloodstream to only
a limited extent. This may be because it does not cross the
alveolar epithelium or is rapidly degraded locally. It is also

sufﬁciently stimulated for PAD release before blood sam-
pling in this study.

Importantly, the PAD contained in the serum samples
was enzymatically active in many cases. Thus, PAD
inﬂammation
released into the circulation during local
may citrullinate extracellular proteins, which potentially
modify their functional properties or render proteins anti-
genic. Surprisingly, we found that the PAD contained in
the blood of smokers was less active than that of non-
smokers. The PAD activity of serum from smokers could
be restored by addition of the reducing agent DTT, which
suggests that PAD is inactivated by oxidation in the blood
of smokers, presumably by reactive oxygen species
released as a consequence of smoking.26 It is possible
that circulating inactive PAD can be reactivated at anato-
mical sites with a reducing environment. Thus, PAD activ-
ity can be restored in synovial ﬂuid from RA patients after
addition of a reducing agent,10 but to our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst time that catalytic activity has been observed in
serum without addition of reducing agents.

The fact that only PAD2 levels increased during surgery
in this study suggests that PAD2 is predominantly responsi-
ble for the observed PAD activity in the blood. Neutrophils
are a predominant source of PAD2 and PAD4,9,10,12 and our
ﬁnding that the increase in PAD2 levels during surgery
correlated with the increase in neutrophil activation markers –
but not with changes in proinﬂammatory cytokines – is in
keeping with this. This agrees with previous ﬁndings that
extracellular activity of PAD released from neutrophils
in vitro is primarily mediated by PAD2.29 PAD2 is rapidly
released from neutrophils on stimulation,12 and with blood
sampling 2 hrs after surgery, it is likely that the PAD2
released during the surgical procedure was pre-formed rather
than synthesized de novo. The measurements of PAD4 in this
study should be interpreted with caution, however, since low
recovery was observed in the PAD4 ELISA after spiking of
PAD4 into serum.

CABG surgery is based on the use of the CPB, which is
known to induce ischemia, neutrophil activation, and
a systemic inﬂammatory response which exceeds that
observed after other major surgical procedures.21,23 We cannot
rule out that the neutrophil activation observed in this study and
any consequent PAD release were caused by sheer mechanical
stress or hypoxia. However, extracellular PAD activity is
observed as a consequence of inﬂammatory stimuli,30 so we
propose that PAD2 release and an increase in circulating PAD
activity are features of acute inﬂammation in a broader sense.
This remains to be tested in other inﬂammatory conditions.

Conclusion
PAD2 is released into circulation during CABG surgery
with CPB, and the PAD released is enzymatically active.
The increase in PAD2 levels correlated with an increase in
neutrophil activation markers, indicating that neutrophils
were the predominant source of PAD2. Smoking had no
statistically signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on circulating PAD2
levels, and the catalytic activity of circulating PAD was
unexpectedly decreased among smokers. The implications
of this remain to be investigated.
