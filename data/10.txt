Purpose: This  study  aimed  to  evaluate  the  diagnostic  value  of  the  different  Complete  blood  count-derived  systemic  inflammation 
indexes,  including  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR),  platelet-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (PLR),  systemic  immune-inflammation  index 
(SII), and neutrophil to lymphocyte × platelet ratio (NLPR) in differential diagnosing the chronic calculus cholecystitis (CCC) and the 
acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC), as well as determining the severity of ACC.
Patients and Methods: 105 CCC and 88 ACC patients were enrolled. NLR, PLR, SII, and NLPR were evaluated in both cohorts as 
well as in different severity levels of ACC. The severity of ACC was determined based on the Tokyo Guidelines. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and Univariate/multivariate regression analyses were conducted.
Results:  The  levels  of  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  significantly  higher  in  the  ACC  group  compared  to  the  CCC  group.  The 
optimal  cutoff  values  for  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  determined  to  be  3.89,  144.7,  896.8,  and  0.031  respectively.  NLR>3.89 
demonstrates the highest predictive capability with an AUC of 0.801 and a sensitivity of 72.73%. Multivariate analysis showed that 
NLR>3.89 (OR: 4.169, p = 0.004) and NLPR>0.031 (OR: 4.304, p = 0.005) were dominant in distinguishing ACC from CCC. In ACC 
patients, the levels of NLR, SII, and NLPR were significantly higher in the Moderate to Severe-degree ACC (MS-ACC) group than in 
Mild-Degree  ACC  (M-ACC).  NLPR  >  0.044  exhibited  the  highest  predictive  ability  with  an  AUC  of  0.778  and  a  specificity  of 
91.67%.  Multivariate  analysis  showed  that  NLR>6.399  (OR:  10.308,  p  =  0.000)  was  a  possible  independent  prognostic  factor  for 
accessing the severity of ACC.
Conclusion: Systemic inflammation indexes can be useful in predicting the risk of ACC and MS-ACC. NLR demonstrates the best 
distinguishing power and sensitivity for distinguishing ACC from CCC, while NLPR shows the best predictive power and specificity 
for predicting the severity of ACC.

Introduction
Cholecystitis is a widespread issue characterized by inflammation of the gallbladder, often prompted by blockage of the 
cystic duct.1  Calculous cholecystitis (CC) accounts for 95% of cases and can be further classified as chronic calculous 
cholecystitis (CCC) or acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) based on the severity of clinical manifestations and the rate of 
disease progression.2,3

Currently, Cholecystitis cannot be definitively diagnosed through a single examination. Diagnosis relies primarily on 
a thorough medical history, symptoms, physical examination, and imaging findings.4 The gold standard for differentiating 
between acute and chronic cholecystitis is the use of pathologic findings from cholecystectomy. During the pre-operative 
period,  imaging  of  the  gallbladder  plays  a  crucial  role  in  distinguishing  between  the  CCC  and  ACC.  While

ultrasonography  is  commonly  used,  it  may  not  provide  conclusive  results  in  some  patients.5,6  Computed  tomography 
(CT)  has  its  limitations,  including  the  risk  of  false-positive  and  false-negative  diagnoses,  radiation  exposure,  and 
potential  nephrotoxic  effects  from  contrast  media.7,8  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  is  accurate  in  differentiating 
ACC from CCC due to its superior soft-tissue contrast resolution,5,9 but it can be costly and time-consuming. The use of 
MRI may be limited to severely ill patients and may not be feasible in settings with limited medical resources.

Research is ongoing on the role of biomarkers in predicting the severity of ACC. Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) is 
a  widely  accepted  standard  for  assessing  the  severity  of  ACC  using  scoring  systems.4  However,  it  involves  collecting 
numerous parameters.

Thus,  accurately  diagnosing  different  types  of  cholecystitis  in  the  pre-operative  period  often  poses  challenges  for 
clinicians.  Nonetheless,  accurate  diagnosis  is  crucial  for  appropriate  treatment  and  optimal  patient  outcomes.4,10  For 
patients  exhibiting  symptoms  of  CCC,  elective  cholecystectomy  is  recommended.  Prompt  urgent  cholecystectomy  is 
imperative  for  those  with  mild  ACC  while  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  ACC  require  urgent  or  early  gallbladder 
drainage  in  addition  to  initial  medical  treatment  and  organ  support.11  Delayed  or  incorrect  diagnosis  can  lead  to 
complications, including gallbladder perforation, sepsis, and even septic shock. In patients with severe sepsis or shock 
caused by cholelithiasis, the mortality rate exceeds 60%.12 Therefore, rapid, accurate diagnosis and evaluation are crucial 
for developing the best treatment plan and providing timely and effective care when cholecystitis occurs.

Previous  studies  have  elucidated  that  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count  and  leukocyte  subtype  cells  are  valuable 
indicators  for  predicting  the  inflammatory  process  in  acute  cholecystitis.13–17  WBC  count  has  been  established  as  the 
primary biomarker for assessing the severity of cholecystitis.4  Elevated WBC count is often observed due to the robust 
inflammatory response triggered by gallstone blockage.18  In addition, Platelets also play a role in inflammation and host 
defense.19  Several  inflammatory  parameters  based  on  WBC  and  platelet  counts,  such  as  the  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio  (NLR),  platelet-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (PLR),  systemic  immune-inflammation  index  (SII),  and  neutrophil-to- 
lymphocyte  platelet  ratio  (NLPR),  as  potential  valuable  indicators  in  assessing  the  inflammatory  process.  This  study 
aimed  to  evaluate  the  diagnostic  effectiveness  and  practical  application  of  these  systemic  inflammatory  indexes  in 
patients  with  CC.  These  indices  could  offer  a  rapid,  accessible,  easy-to-calculate,  and  cost-effective  method  for 
differentiating diagnose ACC from CCC as well as determining the severity of ACC, particularly in developing nations 
where access to advanced imaging and diagnostic tools may be limited.

Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
This prospective, observational, and single-center study was conducted at the hepatobiliary surgery of Wenzhou Central 
Hospital. The research was carried out from June 2022 to September 2023, involving 250 patients who had undergone 
cholecystectomy  due  to  ACC  or  CCC.  Histopathological  examination  was  performed  on  the  resected  gallbladders. 
Diagnosis of CCC and ACC before surgery primarily relied on a combination of detailed medical history, comprehensive 
clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations. The final confirmation of the diagnosis of both ACC 
and CCC was based on the pathological examination of  postoperative gallbladder tissue specimens.  The ACC patients 
underwent  further  classification  by  the  TG18  into  three  severity  grades:4  Moderate  ACC  is  related  to  any  one  of  the 
following  conditions:  (1)  elevated  WBC  count  (>18,000/mm3);  (2)  palpable  tender  mass  in  the  right  upper  abdominal 
quadrant; (3) the duration of complaints > 72 h; (4) marked local inflammation (gangrenous cholecystitis, pericholecystic 
abscess, hepatic abscess, biliary peritonitis, emphysema cholecystitis). Severe ACC is associated with dysfunction of any 
one of the following organs/systems: (1) cardiovascular dysfunction: hypotension requiring treatment with dopamine ≥ 5 
μg/kg  per  minute,  or  any  dose  of  norepinephrine;  (2)  neurological  dysfunction:  decreased  level  of  consciousness;  (3) 
respiratory  dysfunction:  PaO2  /FiO2  ratio  <  300;  (4)  renal  dysfunction:  oliguria,  creatinine  >  2.0  mg/dL;  (5)  hepatic 
dysfunction: PT international normalized ratio (INR)> 1.5; (6) hematological dysfunction: platelet count < 100,000/mm3. 
Mild  ACC  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  “Moderate”  or  “Severe”  ACC.  Patients  with  Moderate-  and  severe-degree 
inflammations  were  grouped  as  the  high-degree  inflammation  group  and  compared  with  the  mild-degree  inflammation 
group. The criteria for exclusion were established as follows: (1) Patients below 18 years of age or above 90 years of age,

cholelithiasis, (4) complicated with serious medical diseases such as heart, lung, brain or kidney, (5) complicated with 
other  acute  or  chronic  infections,  autoimmune,  malignant  tumors,  or  inflammatory  diseases,  (7)  non-calculous 
cholecystitis.

Blood sampling and Biochemical Analysis
Blood  specimens  were  collected  under  sterile  conditions  on  Day  1  of  hospital  admission.  EDTA-anticoagulated  blood 
sample (2 mL) was used for the determination of routine blood count through the Sysmex XE-2100 Hematology System 
(East Asia Company, Japan). Blood parameters, such as neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and platelet counts were 
all  recorded.  The  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  calculated  as  follows:  NLR  (neutrophils/lymphocytes  ratio),  PLR 
(platelets/lymphocytes  ratio),  SII  ((neutrophils  ×  platelets)/lymphocytes),  NLPR  (neutrophils/  (lymphocytes  ×  platelets 
ratio)). Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected into pre-coagulation tubes and centrifuged for the serum. The serum was 
then analyzed for various biochemical parameters including ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminase), 
GGT  (gamma-glutamyl  transpeptidase),  ALP  (alkaline  phosphatase),  TC  (total  cholesterol),  TG  (triglyceride),  HDL-C 
(high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol),  LDL-C  (low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol),  Apo  AI  (apolipoprotein  AI),  Apo 
B  (apolipoprotein  B),  and  Lp  (a)  (a-lipoprotein),  CREA  (creatinine)  using  the  Beckman  Coulter  AU5800  Automatic 
Biochemical Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Co. Ltd. USA). Sodium citrate-anticoagulation blood sample (5 mL) was used 
for the INR analysis through the STA-R Evolution® Experts series (STAGO, France). All determinations were performed 
in the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the Wenzhou Central Hospital. The normal ranges of serum TC, TG, HDL- 
C,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  Apo  B,  and  Lp  (a)  levels  in  our  Clinical  Science  Experiment  Center  were  2.44–5.17,  0.40–1.70, 
1.16–1.42, 2.07–3.10 mmol/L, 1.00–1.6, 0.60–1.1 g/L and 0–300 mg/L, respectively.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.27 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was 
used  to  determine  whether  variables  were  normally  distributed.  Mean  ±  standard  deviation  (SD)  was  used  to  present 
normally  distributed  variables,  and  median  and  interquartile  range  (IQR)  values  were  used  for  abnormally  distributed 
variables, while categorical variables were reported as percentages. Comparisons between groups were performed using 
the  Mann–Whitney  test  and  Chi-square  test  for  numerical  and  categorical  variables,  respectively.  Receiver  operating 
characteristics  (ROC)  curve  analysis  was  performed  to  estimate  optimal  cut-off  values,  maximizing  sensitivity  and 
specificity according to the Youden index. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis for each factor were 
performed  by  logistics  regression  analysis.  These  parameters  were  treated  as  binary  variables  and  were  dichotomized 
based  on  optimal  cut-off  values  or  mean  values.  Variables  with  statistical  significance  (P-value  <  0.1)  in  univariable 
regression models were included in the multivariable regression model using the “forward LR” method to determine their 
significance  after  adjustment  for  potential  confounders.  All  tests  were  two-tailed  and  P-value  <  0.05  was  considered 
statistically significant.

Results
General Patient Characteristics
A total of 105 patients with CCC (36 male, 69 female) with a median age of 52 years (range: 18–80) and 88 patients with 
ACC (51 male, 37 female) with a median age of 56.5 years (range: 23–88) were included in this study based on specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The laboratory findings indicated that patients with ACC had significantly higher levels 
of liver function enzymes such as AST, ALP, and GGT compared to CCC patients, with GGT showing the most notable 
increase.  Conversely,  ACC  patients  exhibited  decreased  concentrations  of  TC,  TG,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  and  Apo  B  in 
comparison  to  CCC  patients.  Furthermore,  ACC  patients had  higher  White  blood  cell  and  neutrophil  counts  but lower 
relative lymphocyte counts compared to CCC patients. Detailed demographic information and serum parameter distribu-
tions of the patients can be found in Table 1.

Among the patients with ACC, there were 36 cases of mild-degree inflammation (M-ACC) and 52 cases of moderate- 
and  severe-degree  inflammation  (MS-ACC).  Severe  ACC  was  present  in  only  three  patients,  with  one  case  involving 
hepatic dysfunction, another with respiratory complications, and the third demonstrating cardiological dysfunction. The 
average age of patients with M-ACC was 50.4 years, while for the MS-ACC group, it was 59.5 years. Apo AI levels were 
notably lower in MS-ACC patients compared to those with M-ACC. Analysis of blood parameters revealed a significant 
increase  in  WBC  and  neutrophil  counts  in  MS-ACC  patients  compared  to  M-ACC  patients,  whereas  the  lymphocyte 
count was significantly lower in the MS-ACC group than  in the M-ACC group.  The additional laboratory findings for 
M-ACC and MS-ACC patients are shown in Table 2.

The Results of the Assessed Systemic Inflammatory Indexes in Each Group of Patients

(1.519–3.301), P <0.001]. Also, there was a notable rise in the PLR [169.121 (125.75–246.336) and 127.253 (98.612– 
174.706);  respectively,  P  <0.001],  SII  [1470.792  (689.186–2758.316))  and  440.228  (315.366–872.194);  respectively, 
P <0.001] and NLPR [0.030 (0.014–0.058) and 0.008 (0.006–0.015); respectively, P < 0.001], in ACC patients compared 
to the CCC group (Figure 1).

Furthermore, in MS-ACC patients, the NLR, SII, and NPLR values were significantly higher compared to M-ACC 
patients (NLR:9.747 (5.068–14.065) Vs 4.093 (2.020, 5.411); p < 0.001; SII:2218.176 (1176.878–3349.847) vs 932.005

Comparison for Assessing the Discriminative Ability of Each Inflammation Indexes to 
Distinguishing AAC from CCC Patients
Receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve  analysis  was  conducted  to  assess  the  discriminative  ability  of  various 
inflammation indices in differentiating between AAC and CCC patients. The NLR demonstrated a sensitivity of 72.73%, 
a specificity of 80.95%, and an AUC of 0.801 at a cut-off of 3.89 (P < 0.001). The PLR showed a sensitivity of 68.18%, 
a specificity of 61.9%, and an AUC of 0.662 at a cut-off of 144.7. Additionally, the SII exhibited a sensitivity of 69.32%, 
a  specificity  of  76.19%,  and  an  AUC  of  0.777  at  a  cut-off  of  896.8  (P  <  0.001),  while  the  NLPR  had  a  sensitivity  of 
63.64%, a specificity of 86.67%, and an AUC of 0.776 at a cut-off of 0.031 (P < 0.001). Overall, the NLR displayed the 
highest AUC and sensitivity among the indexes assessed (Table 3).

In addition, ROC Curve Analysis demonstrated that NLR, SII, and NLPR might be acceptable in the differentiation of 
M-ACC and MS-ACC patients. The areas under the curve (AUC) for NLR, SII, and NLPR were 0.760, 0.723, and 0.778, 
respectively. The optimal cut-off values were identified as 6.399, 1261, and 0.044 for NLR, SII, and NLPR. Sensitivities

for NLR, SII, and NLPR were found to be 71.15%, 72.22%, and 61.54%, while specificities were 80.56%, 73.08%, and 
91.67%.  Nonetheless,  the  diagnostic  potential  of  PLR  was  not  supported  by  the  ROC  analysis,  as  it  did  not  reach 
a significant level (P = 0.309) (Table 4).

Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis
Univariate  and  multivariable  binary  logistic  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  clinical  significance  of 
Inflammation  Indices  as  biomarkers  in  distinguishing  between  ACC  and  CCC  patients.  Variables  that  demonstrated 
a P-value of <0.1 in the univariate analysis were subsequently included in the multivariable binary logistic analysis, 
encompassing  TC,  TG,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  Apo  B,  sex,  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR.  Notably,  in  the  mutivariate 
analysis, several variables were found to be significant in discriminating between ACC and CCC, including Apo AI/ 
nmol/L  (<1.13)  (OR:  2.284,  P  =  0.031),  Sex  (%)  (OR:  2.369,  P  =  0.025),  NLR  >3.89  (OR:  4.169,  P  =  0.004),  and 
NLPR  >0.031  (OR:  4.304,  P  =  0.005)  (Table  5).

Furthermore,  the  univariate  analysis  identified  NLR,  SII,  NLPR,  and  age  as  risk  factors  for  MS-ACC.  Multiple 
logistic regression models further confirmed that age and NLR were significant independent predictive factors of severity 
in ACC patients. It was shown that when the NLR was more than the cutoff value, there was an increased risk of (10.308 
times higher) moderate to severe degree inflammation compared to the lower NLR (Table 6).

Discussion
In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  assess  the  diagnostic  role  of  various  systemic  inflammatory  indices  derived  from  Complete 
Blood Count in acute and chronic cholecystitis, as well as in differentiating between M-ACC and MS-ACC patients. Our 
research  revealed  that  elevated  levels  of  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  associated  with  ACC  compared  to  CCC 
patients. Additionally, among ACC patients, there was a significant increase in NLR, SII, and NLPR in those with MS- 
ACC compared to M-ACC patients. We indicated that the cut-off values for NLR, PLR, SII, and NLPR in differentiating 
between  ACC  and  CCC  patients  were  3.89,  144.7,  896.8,  and  0.031  (respectively),  while  in  distinguishing  between 
M-ACC  and  MS-ACC  patients,  the  cut-off  value  for  NLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  was  much  higher  (6.39,  1261  and  0.044,

thereby potentially assisting in averting complications and fatalities.

Considering the four inflammatory parameters associated with CC, NLR has been extensively studied and is considered 
a reliable marker for prognosticating diseases involving inflammatory and infective processes.20,21  Previous literature has 
shown that NLR is significantly higher in acute cholecystitis compared to healthy controls, ranging from 5.29–12.16 compared 
to 1.73–2.98.14,22–25 However, there have been limited studies focusing on the predictive value of NLR in differentiating acute 
and chronic cholecystitis. Our study supports previous findings that NLR levels were significantly higher in acute cholecystitis 
compared to chronic cholecystitis.23 We found that an NLR value above 3.89 was significant in the ACC group compared to 
the CCC group, and above 6.399 was significant in the MS-ACC patients. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that 
an  NLR  exceeding  the  cutoff  value  independently  predicts  ACC  and  its  severity.  The  increase  in  NLR  cutoff  values 
corresponds  to  higher  estimates  of  inflammatory  severity,  which  can  be  attributed  to  an  imbalance  in  the  inflammatory 
response with elevated neutrophil levels. This imbalance may result in the exhaustion of the immune system and a decrease in 
lymphocyte counts, subsequently triggering an aggressive inflammatory reaction through the activation of the innate immune

system.26 Consistent with our findings, a study by Sang Kuon Lee et al observed a significant association between NLR and 
gangrenous cholecystitis (GC), where each standard deviation increase in NLR corresponded to a 48% heightened probability 
of GC.24 Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis has suggested that while NLR can predict acute cholecystitis, it may not have the 
ability to predict disease severity.25 The ability of NLR to accurately differentiate the severity of ACC is a topic of ongoing 
debate, potentially influenced by variations in severity grade definitions across different studies. Further research is needed to 
clarify this matter.

PLR, another inflammatory marker based on complete blood count values, has shown potential as a prognostic marker 
in inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In our research, we observed that a PLR of 144.7 effectively distinguished 
between  ACC  and  CCC,  with  a  sensitivity  of  68.18%,  specificity  of  61.9%,  and  ROC  AUC  of  66.20%.  A  recently 
published  study  has  also  indicated  that  a  PLR  of  148.13  could  be  considered  a  valuable  inflammatory  biomarker  for 
ACC, demonstrating a sensitivity of 77.9%, specificity of 76.2%, and ROC AUC of 74.14%.27 Gökçe F et al highlighted 
the potential of NLR and PLR in guiding CRP and leukocyte values in acute cholecystitis.23  while Turhan et al’s study 
identified  a  PLR  value  over  146.90  as  a  predictive  marker  of  complicated  cholecystitis.28  Furthermore,  another  study 
showcased that a PLR equal to or greater than 154.73 indicates severe cholecystitis.29 However, our investigation did not 
yield significant evidence for using PLR to assess the severity of ACC. Similarly, in a recent study evaluating PLR, it was 
found that it can identify gangrenous acute cholecystitis with a cutoff value greater than 175, but PLR was not found to 
be an independent factor for gangrene.18  PLR holds promise as a prognostic and diagnostic tool in various inflammatory 
conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its potential in assessing disease severity.

SII, as determined by peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, has proven to be a valuable indicator for 
evaluating the immune and inflammatory status of patients. Previous studies have shown its potential for diagnosing and 
predicting  various  diseases,  such  as  esophageal  and  pancreatic  cancers.30,31  In  the  context  of  cholecystitis,  previous 
studies  have  revealed  that  SII  levels  exhibit  a  significant  elevation  in  patients  with  acute  cholecystitis  compared  to 
healthy individuals.32  Furthermore, SII can serve as a positive predictor for the severity of acute cholecystitis.33  It has 
also  demonstrated  associations  with  short-term  outcomes  and  advanced  forms  of  acute  cholecystitis.13,34  Within  our 
study, we observed that the cutoff value of SII for differentiating between ACC and CCC was 896.8, and for predicting 
MS-ACC it was >1261. These findings indicated the potential clinical utility value of SII in assessing the severity and 
prognosis of acute cholecystitis.

NLPR,  also  describing  the  interaction  of  acute  processes  of  the  immune  system  and  immunobiotics  involving 
neutrophils,  lymphocytes, and platelets,35  has  not yet been  extensively studied in  patients with cholecystitis.  However, 
NLPR has been investigated as a routine CBC inflammation index in other diseases, such as COVID-19 and acute kidney

injury, showing potential as a risk factor or marker of disease severity.36,37 In our study, we have observed that the NLPR 
value  is  the  most  reliable  parameter  indicating  the  severity  of  ACC,  with  the  highest  AUC  of  0.778  and  specificity  of 
91.67%.  Moreover,  based  on  multivariate  analysis,  NLPR  was  also  identified  as  an  independent  risk  factor,  its  cut-off 
value for the predictive of ACC was 0.031. Further research is needed to explore the utility of NLPR in cholecystitis and 
other inflammatory conditions.

Our research encountered several limitations. Initially, the patient pool was confined to a single hospital, which may 
have restricted the broader applicability of the results. Additionally, the sample size of 193 cases, with just three severe 
ACC instances, was deemed inadequate. Subsequent studies ought to incorporate larger cohorts to affirm the efficacy of 
inflammation  indexes  for  severe  ACC  cases.  Lastly,  our  investigation  did  not  delve  into  the  correlation  between 
Inflammation Indexes and the development of postoperative complications.

Conclusion
Our research shows that indicators such as NLR, PLR, SII, and NPLR have the potential to differentiate between ACC 
and CCC patients. NLR demonstrates the highest sensitivity and accuracy in this differentiation. Additionally, an increase 
in NLR, SII, and NPLR, from specific cut-off values, but not PLR, can predict the severity of ACC in patients. Notably, 
NPLR exhibits the highest specificity among the studied indicators. Importantly, our analysis identified NLR as the only 
factor independently and precisely associated with the severity of ACC. These findings highlight the potential of CBC as 
a  readily  available,  and  inexpensive  test  for  predicting  the  severity  of  cholecystitis  early  on,  thus  facilitating  more 
accurate  clinical  decision-making.  This  approach  may  be  particularly  beneficial  for  medical  professionals  in  countries 
with limited resources.
