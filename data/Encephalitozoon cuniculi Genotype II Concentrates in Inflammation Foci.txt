Background:  Microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  are  generally  connected  with 
severe infections with lethal outcome in immunodeficient hosts. In immunocompetent hosts, 
microsporidiosis  typically  establishes  a  balanced  host–parasite  relationship  that  produces 
minimal  clinically  overt  disease.  Although  the  alimentary  tract  represents  one  of  the  main 
primary target tissues, the mechanisms of reaching other tissues during systemic microspor-
idian infections remain unclear.
Methods:  In  the  present  study,  we  tested  the  relation  between  inflammation  induction  in 
immunocompetent  and  immunodeficient  mice  and  the  presence  of  spores  of  E.  cuniculi 
genotype  II  in  selected  organs  and  in  fecal  specimens  by  using  molecular  and  histology 
methods.
Results:  We  reported  the  positive  connection  between  inflammation  induction  and  the 
significant  increase  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  occurrence  in  inflammation  foci  in  both 
immunodeficient 
immunocompetent  BALB/c  and 
(SCID)  mice  in  the  acute  phase  of  infection  and  the  re-activation  of  latent  microsporidial 
infection following inflammation induction in immunocompetent mice.
Conclusion:  The  results  imply  possible  involvement  of  immune  cells  serving  as  vehicles 
transporting  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  purposefully  across  the  whole  host  body  towards 
inflammation. With increasing number of records of infections, it is necessary to reconsider 
microsporidia  as  agents  responsible  for  various  pathologies.  The  elucidation  of  possible 
connection  with  pro-inflammatory  immune  responses  represents  an  important  challenge 
with consequences for human health and development of therapeutic strategies.

Introduction
Microsporidia are obligatory intracellular eukaryotic parasites belonging to the phy-
lum  Microsporidia  within  the  kingdom  Opisthokonta  infecting  a  broad  range  of 
animals  including  protists,  invertebrates,  and  vertebrates.  They  have  been  studied 
for  more  than  150  years  mainly  for  their  ability  to  cause  extensive  damage  to  the 
host  organism,  mainly  in  husbandly  important  farmed  animals  such  as  silkworms, 
bees, and fish.1,2  In mammals, infections typically establish a balanced host–parasite 
relationship  that produce minimal  clinically overt disease  in  immunocompetent nat-
ural  hosts.3–8  A  shift  in  the  balance  toward  immune  deficiency  or  hyperimmune 
responses,  however,  produces  overt  clinical  signs  of  disease.  In  the  past,  human 
microsporidial  infections  were  most  commonly  associated  with  immunodeficiency, 
so they were often diagnosed in AIDS patients, organ recipients, and children.3 Of the 
~1500  described  microsporidia  species,  17  species  are  known  to  infect  humans,  of

which  Encephalitozoon  spp.  and  Enterocytozoon  bieneusi 
are reported from most of the symptomatic patients.8,9  The 
first microsporidian successfully isolated for long-term cul-
ture,  Encephalitozoon  cuniculi,  belongs  to  the  best-studied 
microsporidian species with four different, not strictly host-

III=“dog”, IV=“human”) determined according to the num-
ber  of  short  repeats  in  the  ribosomal  internal  transcribed 
spacer (ITS) region.10,11 Encephalitozoon species infect sev-
eral cell types in mammalian hosts, including epithelial and 
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and astrocytes.12 
In  addition  to  gastrointestinal  tract  involvement,  patients 
with  encephalitis,  ocular  infection,  sinusitis,  myositis,  and 
disseminated infection are described in the literature.13–17

With the establishment of modern diagnostic methods, 
microsporidia  have  been  detected  in  immunocompetent 
individuals,  such  as  travelers,  diabetics,  pregnant  women, 
and  the  elderly.9,–18–24  Immune  suppression  caused  by 
chemotherapy,  immunomodulating  drugs,  and  solid  organ 
or bone marrow transplantation, has been demonstrated to 
be  an  important  risk  factor  for  the  development  of 
microsporidiosis.25  Microsporidiosis  is  not  limited,  how-
ever,  to  immunocompromised  states,  and  infections  with 
these organisms occur in immunocompetent individuals as 
well.26,27  Furthermore, asymptomatic microsporidia infec-
tions have been recognized in the case of diseases with an 
ambiguous etiology, such as encephalitis or periprosthetic 
osteolysis.8,28,29 Microsporidia are often overlooked due to 
the  problematic  diagnosis,  resulting  in  the  increased  pos-
sibility  of  hidden  infections  causing  huge  damage  and 
various non-specific pathologies, often without application 
of effective treatment.30

The present study was designed to answer the question 
raised  based  on  literary  data29  and  factual  lack  of  active 
motility of microsporidia, if the microsporidian E. cuniculi 
could be secondarily  transferred to  the site of  experimen-
tally induced inflammation in cellular vehicles attracted to 
the inflammation focus.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All  experimental  procedures  were  performed  in  accor-
dance with  the  law  of  Czech  Republic  (Act  No 246/1992 
Coll.,  on  the  protection  of  animals  against  cruelty).  The 
study  design  was  approved  by  ethical  committees  at  the 
Biology  Centre  of  the  Czech  Academy  of  Sciences,  the 
the  Central 
State  Veterinary  Administration,  and 

Commission  for  Animal  Welfare  under  protocols  no. 
100/2016 and 35/2020, respectively.

Mice
Eight-week-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) 
and immunocompetent (BALB/c) mice originally obtained 
from  Charles  River  (Sulzfeld,  Germany)  were  bred  under 
sterile  condition  and  supplied  with  a  sterilized  diet  and 
sterilized water ad libitum.

Parasites
The  spores  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  originally  isolated 
from  a  dexamethasone-treated  laboratory  mouse31  were 
cultivated  in  vitro  for  the  purpose  of  the  experiment 
according to Kotková et al.32

Experimental Protocol
All mice were per orally infected with the dose of 107  E. 
cuniculi  genotype  II  spores  in  0.2  mL  of  deionized  water 
using intragastric gavage. The inflammation in experimen-
tal SCID and BALB/c was induced by the usage of 50 μL 
of  Freund’s  Incomplete  Adjuvant  (Sigma-Aldrich,  St. 
Louis,  MO,  USA)  inoculated  in  either  acute  (7  or  28 
days  post-infection  (DPI)  in  BALB/c  mice,  respectively; 
seven DPI in SCID mice) or chronic phase (56 or 77 DPI 
in  BALB/c  mice,  respectively)  of  infection32  to  the  hind 
limb  muscles  (Table  1).  Mice  of  both  strains  injected 
intramuscularly  with  50  μL  of  sterile  phosphate  buffered 
solution (PBS) at the same intervals were used as negative 
controls.  Three  mice  from  each  strain  were  separately 
examined  for  microsporidia  shedding  in  feces  on  a  daily 
basis  and  fecal  samples  were  stored  at  −20°C  for  further 
molecular  analyses.  The  animal’s  health,  mortality,  and 
morbidity were recorded at 12-hour intervals.

Three  mice  from  each  group  were  euthanized  by  cer-
vical dislocation every seventh DPI and sterile samples for 
molecular  detection  and  histology  were  prepared  from 
limb muscles and liver by the usage of a different pair of 
sterile dissection tools (Table 1).

DNA Isolation
Total  DNA  from  samples  was  extracted  as  described  by 
Sak  et  al33  following  bead  homogenization.  Extracted 
DNA was stored at −20°C.

PCR Amplification
Nested PCR protocols34,35 were used for amplification of a 
partial  sequence  of  16S  rRNA.  Encephalitozoon  cuniculi

genotype I DNA and ultrapure water were used as positive 
and negative controls, respectively.

qRT-PCR
The protocols described by Wolk et al36 and Dai et al37 were 
used for amplification of 16S rRNA gene of E. cuniculi and 
β-actin  as  a  housekeeping  gene,  respectively.  Each  run 
included unspiked specimens and diluent blanks as negative 
controls. Positive results were determined based on mathe-
matical  algorithms  included  with  the  LightCycler  system 
(Roche,  Praha,  the  Czech  Republic).  Results  were  deter-
mined  to  be  positive  when  the  fluorescence  signal  crossed 
the baseline at ≤43 cycles. The total amount of spores in 1 g 
of individual fecal or tissue samples was calculated based on 
the standard curve derived from serial dilutions of spores in 
water  and  fecal  samples  of  known  weight  or  recalculated 
based on the number of β-actin copies in the tissue sample, 
respectively.38,39

Histology
Tissues  samples  were  processed  by  the  usual  paraffin 
method  following  fixation  in  10%  buffered  formalin.  The 
sections were stained with Brown and Brenn Gram stain.40

Statistical Analysis
Differences  in  microsporidia  presence  in  inflammatory 
foci  compared  to  noninduced  site  were  analyzed  by  stu-
dent  T-tests  and  the  conformity  of  the  variances  of  the 
tested  groups  was  verified  by  an  F-test  at  a  confidence 
level  of  α=0.05  and  lower.  The  differences  in  the  spore 
shedding  frequencies  within  individual  groups  were  ana-
lyzed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests. All com-
putations were made using Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft 
CR, Praha, Czech Republic).

Results
The application of Freund’s Incomplete Adjuvant induced 
localized  inflammatory  immune  response  in  all  animals 
(Figure  1A).  There  was  no  difference  observed  in  the 
induction  of  lesions  between  infected  and  non-infected 
groups. On the other hand, neither macroscopic nor micro-
scopic changes were observed in PBS inoculated mice.

in  all  screened  tissue  samples  at  least  in  one  animal  per 
group  (Figure  2A).  An  induction  of  inflammation  in  the 
acute  phase  of  infection  7.  DPI  in  immunocompetent 
BALB/c  mice  led  to  the  disappearance  of  microsporidia 
from  non-induced  leg  and  increase  of  their  concentration 
towards  induced  leg  in  all  experimental  mice  (P<0.05) 
from  14  day  post-infection  (DPI)  to  35  DPI  reaching  up 
to 7.8×102  spores per 1  g of tissue reported 1  week post- 
inflammation induction (Figure 2A). On the other hand, no 
difference  was  observed  between  the  occurrence  frequen-
cies  and  spore  burden  of  microsporidia  in  legs  in  the 
control group (Figure 2A).

After  secondary  induction  of  inflammation,  28  DPI  in 
the left leg E. cuniculi genotype II shifted to the new site 
of  inflammation,  especially  42  DPI  reaching  4.8×104 
spores  per  gram  of  tissue  compared  to  the  right  leg, 
where 3.0×102 were detected. Also the frequency of occur-
rence  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  in  a  particular  leg  was 
higher in induced legs, as the microsporidia were detected 
at  least  in  two  of  three  examined  animals  per  interval, 
compared  to  non-induced  ones  showing  the  presence  of 
E. cuniculi genotype II mostly in one animal per interval. 
The  occurrence  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  also  con-
firmed  histologically  at  42  DPI  in  the  left  induced  leg 
(Figure  1B).  Surprisingly,  induction  of  inflammation  led 
to a prolonged occurrence of E. cuniculi genotype II in all 
screened tissues of the experimental group (P<0.05) com-
pared to the control group, where gradual disappearance of 
E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  from  tested  tissues  was  observed 
starting  from  35  DPI,  indicating  a  positive  correlation 
between the presence of inflammation and the persistence 
of detectable infection (Figure 2A).

Encephalitozoon  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  detected  in 
feces in both groups of BALB/c mice in the acute phase of 
infection from the 2 DPI (Figure 3A). Induction of inflam-
mation by Freund’s adjuvant led to discontinued excretion 
of spores in the feces for 15 days after primary induction 
and irregular spores secretion after secondary induction of 
inflammation,  whereas  in  the  control  group  specific  E. 
cuniculi  DNA  in  the  feces  was  observed  significantly 
more  frequently  during  whole  experiment  without  any 
relevant interruption.

after  the  inflammation  induction  in  the  chronic  phase  of 
infection  of  56  DPI  in  BALB/c  mice  (Figure  2B),  the 
infection  was  reactivated  in  all  experimental  mice  and 
microsporidia  were  detected  in  both  legs  regardless  of 
the site of inflammation induction. In addition, E. cuniculi 
genotype  II  reappeared  also  in  the  liver,  even  though  the 
maximum  spore  burden  was  10-times  lower  than  in  the

case  of  induction  of  inflammation  in  the  acute  phase  of 
infection (Figure 2B).

A  similar  effect  was  observed  after  secondary  induc-
tion  of  inflammation  in  the  chronic  phase  of  infection  of 
77 DPI with no specific migration of E. cuniculi genotype 
II to the inflammatory focus, but activation of latent infec-
tion  in  experimental  BALB/c  mice,  showing  a  significant 
increase  in  the  spore  burden  in  the  induced  group  com-
pared to control mice (P<0.05) (Figure 2B).

Similar to the experiment performed in the acute phase 
of the infection, a significant decrease in fecal spore excre-
tion was observed in the group with induced inflammation 
(Figure 3B). Although the presence of specific E. cuniculi 
genotype II DNA in feces was demonstrated irregularly in 
both  groups  of  immunocompetent  mice  until  the  55  DPI, 
E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  no  longer  excreted  in  feces 
after induction of inflammation in the experimental group.

Induction of Inflammation in SCID Mice
In  immunodeficient  SCID  mice,  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II 
was detected in all screened tissue already prior to induc-
tion  of  inflammation  (Figure  2C).  After  induction  of 
inflammation  of  7  DPI,  in  the  experimental  group  a  sig-
nificant  (P<0.05)  increase  in  the  number  of  spores  in  the 
induced right hind leg of 21 DPI reaching 7.8×105  spores 
per gram  of  tissue  was  observed  compared  to  the  left  leg 
containing 3.5×105  spores per gram of tissue. In addition, 
there  was  an  overall  increase  in  the  number  of  spores  in 
both  limbs  and  liver  of  induced  animals  compared  to  the 
control mice, especially 21 DPI. At the end of the experi-
ment, 28 DPI, however, the number of spores in both legs 
was similar and comparable to control animals, where the 
spore  burden  was  approximately  the  same  for  both  limbs 
throughout  the whole  experiment. The presence of spores 
of microsporidia in the site of inflammation in the right leg 
was also observed histologically (Figure 1C).

In most SCID mice, E. cuniculi specific DNA in feces 
were  recorded  starting  from  2  DPI  (Figure  3C).  Spores 
were  excreted  in  the  feces  throughout  the  infection  until 
the  end  of  the  experiment,  regardless  of  the  induction  of 
inflammation.

In  contrast  to  BALB/c  mice,  clinical  signs  of  micro-
sporidiosis,  including  bristly  hair,  hunched  back,  and 
cachexia,  were  observed  in  SCID  mice,  especially  at  the 
end  of  the  study  period.  However,  diarrhea  as  one  of  the 
main symptoms of microsporidiosis caused by E. cuniculi 
was not observed in SCID mice either.

Discussion
Microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  are  typically 
described as chronic, slow acting pathogens and, thus, less 

virulent than other pathogen groups. However, they are able 

to  multiply  successfully  in  an  appropriate  host  to  an  enor-

mous  amount  without  any  obvious  signs  of  infection  in 

immunocompetent  hosts,  revealing  that  high  infectivity, 

high  pathogenicity,  or  both  do  not  necessarily  predict  the 

level  at  which  a  microsporidian  pathogen  impacts  the  host 
population.33,39,41  The problematics are complicated by the 
fact that microsporidia are often overlooked and underdiag-

nosed, resulting in the increased possibility of hidden infec-

tions  causing  huge  damage  and  various  non-specific 
pathologies prior getting detected and successfully treated.28
Environmentally resistant life cycle stages of microspor-
idia, spores, are excreted in feces, urine, or sputum causing 
infection by ingesting contaminated food or water and less 
often by  inhaling  infectious  spores.42,43  Horizontally trans-
mitted  microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  access 
host tissues by germinating in the gut lumen where infections 
are typically initiated in gut epithelial cells, and sometimes 
muscle  cells.  However,  the  target  tissues  –  those  in  which 
microsporidia  develop  to  the  infectious  stage,  represent  a 
species-specific  interaction  with  its  host.  The  alimentary 
tract is a common target tissue for the production of infective 
spores, and infection can be restricted to one portion of the 
gut or include several tissue types. The intensity of infection, 
including  the  amount  and  frequency  of  E.  cuniculi  spores 
secreted, depends on the age and health status of the infected 
individual as well as depends on the species and genotype of 
the infectious agent.42 The results of this work correspond to 
the data published by Sak et al38,39  and Kotková et al,32  ie, 
immunocompetent BALB/c mice shed E. cuniculi spores at a 
significantly  lower  frequency  than  immunodeficient  SCID 
mice.  The  sporadic  presence  of  E.  cuniculi  spores  in  the 
feces  of an  infected  individual  has  also  been  demonstrated 
in  other  studies.26,27,29,32,41  A  positive  correlation  between 
the frequency of excretion and the intensity of infection was 
observed in  BALB/c  and  SCID  mice;  while  BALB/c  mice 
excreted intermittently with an infection intensity of 3.2×106, 
SCID mice excreted almost daily with an intensity of 1.2×108 
spores  per  gram  of  feces.32,38,39  Similarly,  a  child  without 
clinical  signs  of  the  disease  has  been  shown  to  excrete 
1.2×105 spores per gram of stool,44 whereas an immunodefi-
cient  individual  can  excrete  up  to  4.4×108  per  gram  of 
diarrhea.45

structure, the 10–50 μm long polar tube, which is responsible 
for the delivery of this organism to the host cell. Nevertheless, 
Encephalitozoon organisms may replicate to produce mature 
spores  in  a  variety  of  immune  cells  including  resident  and 
trafficking  macrophages  and  other  phagocytic  cells  such  as 
neutrophils,  monocytes,  dendritic  cells,  and  eosinophils 
which may contribute to the spread of E. cuniculi throughout 
the  host  organism,46,47  suggesting  that  induction  of  chemo-
kines  for  inducing  innate  immune  inflammation  may  also 
promote recruitment of host cells for continued infection and 
dissemination48–50 On the other hand, there may be a situation 
in which microsporidia occurring in the area of induced inflam-
mation are eliminated due to the increased occurrence of IFNγ- 
,  LPS-,  and  TNFα-activated  macrophages10,–50–54  by  the 
means of cytotoxic cytokines, cationic proteins, lipid media-
tors,  metalloproteinases,  and  components  of  the  oxygen 
burst.10,51,55

Encephalitozoon  cuniculi  was  recognized  as  a  neglected 
etiological agent for more common, sometimes life-threaten-
ing diseases, such as encephalitis and meningitis, in otherwise 
healthy  individuals28  or  contribute  to  aseptic  periprosthetic 
osteolysis  after  primary  hip  arthroplasty,  leading  to  implant 
loosening  and  urgent  arthroplasty  revision.29  However,  the 
fact  that  microsporidia  occurred  in  the  affected  area  before 
the onset of inflammatory processes, or whether they enter the 
affected area secondarily, either through macrophages or other 
cells involved in the development of inflammation serving as 
vehicles  remained  unanswered.  Our  results  confirmed  the 
targeted  migration  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  to  the  site  of 
inflammation. Although E. cuniculi may be common in mus-
cle, as confirmed by Sak et al56 in a recent study demonstrating 
the occurrence of E. cuniculi genotype II in pig muscle, reach-
ing 60 to 250 spores per gram of meat tissue, in this work we 
showed that the induction of inflammation led to a significant 
increase  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  at  the  induced  site  in 
immunocompetent  BALB/c  mice.  Compared  to  the  control 
group injected with sterile PBS, the occurrence of microspor-
idia in the limbs was random and, from 42 DPI, microsporidia 
in selected organs and tissues were not detected at all, suggest-
ing that during our experiment they may have been eliminated 
by  the  host  immune  system  or  microsporidia  remain  in  the 
body in undetectable amounts. Also induction of inflammation 
in the experimental group of SCID mice led to a significant 
increase of spore burden at the site of inflammation, while in 
the control group, the amount of spores per gram of tissue in 
both limbs was approximately identical. The high concentra-
tion of spores in muscle tissues at the end of the experiment 
could be attributed to the systemic spread of E. cuniculi in the 

terminal  phase  infection,  as  already  described  by  Kotková 
et al.32

So  far,  the  information  available  from  experimental  and 
natural infections suggests that E. cuniculi is able to spread in a 
host rapidly and survive in asymptomatic carriers for a long 
time period, but in some cases the E. cuniculi could be acti-
vated and trigger diseases with ambiguous etiology depending 
on the location. The results obtained in Kicia et al43 pointed to 
a significant association between the occurrence of E. cuniculi 
and  respiratory  symptoms  in  patients  who  have  undergone 
kidney transplantation. However, the question of if microspor-
idia occurred in the respiratory tract in these individuals prior 
to immunosuppressive treatment, as Kotková et al32 and Sak et 
al39 described the common presence of Encephalitozoon spe-
cies  in  the  lungs  of  immunocompetent  individuals,  remains 
unanswered. Our experiments suggested that E. cuniculi gen-
otype  II  could  be  activated  from  latent  phase  not  even  by 
chemotherapy,  but  also  with  inflammation  occurrence.  As 
induction  of  inflammation  in  the  chronic  phase  of  infection 
in  immunocompetent  BALB/c  mice  did  not  directly  affect 
targeted migration of E. cuniculi genotype II to the inflamma-
tory focus, but it led to reactivation of latent infection and E. 
cuniculi  spores  were  repeatedly  detected  in  both  limbs  and 
liver. These results correspond to the results of the study by 
Kotková  et  al,32  who  described  the  reactivation  of  latent  E. 
cuniculi genotype II infection in immunocompetent mice after 
immunosuppression, as well as the ability of this microspor-
idian  to  spread  to  various  tissues  during  chronic  infection, 
including muscles, and to persist at these sites. However, the 
mechanism  of  reactivation  of  E.  cuniculi  by  inflammation 
remains  unclear.  It  can  be  assumed  that  local  induction  of 
chronic inflammation could lead to a reduction in the capacity 
of the immune system, which previously kept the amount of

Unexpectedly, whereas the presence of E. cuniculi geno-
type II in the feces of control groups of immunocompetent 
BALB/c mice in both acute and chronic phase of infection 
was detected intermittently thorough the whole experimental 
period, in experimental groups the excretion of E. cuniculi in 
feces was  reduced  for several  days  or disappeared, respec-
tively,  after  inflammation  induction.  This  phenomenon  can 
be  explained  by  concurrent  increase  of  occurrence  of  E. 
cuniculi genotype II in foci of inflammation and disappear-
ance  of  the  parasite  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  towards

Conclusions
Based on our results we can conclude that the induction of 
inflammation  had  caused  increased  migration  of  E.  cuni-
culi  genotype  II  to  inflammatory  foci  as  the  frequency  of 
spores  was  not  random  but  shifted  in  favor  of  the  site  of 
induced  inflammation  compared  to  control  groups,  where 
spores were accidental or spores or their specific DNA was 
not  detected  at  all.  It  can  be  assumed  that  E.  cuniculi 
genotype  II  could  be  secondarily  transported  to  the  site 
of  inflammation  with  the  contribution  of  immune  cells 
participating  in  its  formation.  E.  cuniculi  are  also  able  to 
survive for a long time in immunocompetent hosts without 
any  clinical  signs,  under  certain  circumstances  the  infec-
tion  may  be  reactivated  after  inflammation  induction. 
However,  the  mechanisms  of  such  migration  as  well  as 
the  vehicle  cells  and  mechanism  of  infection  reactivation 
remain speculative and need to be specified in detail.

The  elucidation  of  possible  connection  with  pro- 
inflammatory  immune  responses,  addressing  the  tissue 
specificity and the mechanisms of transfer to target tissues 
represent  an  important  challenge  with  potential  conse-
quences  for  human  health  and  brings  novel  insight  into 
microsporidia problematic and developing reliable preven-
tive and therapeutic strategies.
