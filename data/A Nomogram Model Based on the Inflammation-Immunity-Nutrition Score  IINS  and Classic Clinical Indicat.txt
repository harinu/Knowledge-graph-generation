Background: Systemic  inflammation,  immunity,  and  nutritional status  are  closely related  to  patients’ outcomes  in  several  kinds  of 
cancers.  This  study  aimed  to  establish  a  new  nomogram  based  on  inflammation-immunity-nutrition  score  (IINS)  to  predict  the 
prognosis of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) patients.
Methods: The clinical data of 435 patients with ENTKL were retrospectively reviewed and randomly assigned to training cohort (n=305) 
and validation cohort (n=131) at a ratio of 7:3. Cox regression analysis was employed to identify independent prognostic factors and develop 
a nomogram in the training cohort. Harrell’s concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
and  decision  curve  analysis  (DCA)  curve  were  employed  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  nomogram  and  compare  it  with  traditional 
prognostic systems (PINK, IPI, KPI). Internal validation was performed using 1000 bootstrap resamples in the validation cohort. Kaplan- 
Meier survival analyses were conducted to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients in different risk groups.
Results:  In  the  training  cohort,  in  addition  to  several  classic  parameters,  IINS  was  identified  as  an  independent  prognostic  factor 
significantly  associated  with  the  OS  of  patients.  The  nomogram  established  based  on  the  independent  prognostic  indicators  showed 
superior survival prediction efficacy, with C-index of 0.733 in the training cohort and 0.759 in the validation cohort compared to the 
PINK (0.636 and 0.737), IPI (0.81 and 0.707), and KPI (0.693 and 0.639) systems. Furthermore, compared with PINK, IPI, and IPI 
systems,  the  nomogram  showed  relatively  superior  calibration  curves  and  more  powerful  prognostic  discrimination  ability  in 
predicting  the  OS  of  patients.  DCA  curves  revealed  some  advantages  in  terms  of  clinical  applicability  of  the  nomogram  compared 
to the PINK, IPI, and IPI systems.
Conclusion:  Compared  with  traditional  prognostic  systems,  the  nomogram  showed  promising  prospects  for  risk  stratification  in 
ENKTL patient prognosis, providing new insights into the personalized treatment.

Introduction
Extranodal  natural  killer/T-cell  lymphoma  (ENKTL),  characterized  by  malignant  proliferation  of  natural  killer  cells  and 
cytotoxic  T  lymphocytes,  is  a  distinctly  heterogeneous  clinicopathological  entity  primarily  occurring  in  Asia  and  South 
America.1,2  In  recent  years,  with  the  optimization  of  radiotherapy  and  L-asparaginase-based  chemotherapy  regimens,  the 
survival  rate  of  ENKTL  patients  has  markedly  improved.  However,  approximately  50%  of  patients  with  advanced-stage 
ENKTL usually develop relapsed/refractory (r/r) disease, and the outcomes in these populations remain dismal.3,4  Several 
prognostic systems, such as the Prognostic Index for Natural Killer Lymphoma (PINK), International Prognostic Index (IPI),

and Korean prognostic index (KPI), are widely used in ENKTL to stratify risk and predict the outcomes of patients, while 
these models do not produce accurate risk stratification to some extent.5–8 In addition, both the IPI and KPI prognostic systems 
were proposed for patients who were treated with anthracycline-containing regimens, such as CHOP and CHOP-like, and may 
not be fully applicable in the era of nonanthracycline chemotherapy.5,8 Therefore, it is extremely important to explore a more 
efficient and accurate prognosis evaluation system for ENKTL.

In  recent  years,  growing  evidence  has  indicated  that  the  inflammatory  response,  immunity  and  nutrition  status  of 
individuals  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  occurrence,  progression,  and  metastasis  of  tumours.9,10  Many  studies  have 
reported that the ratios of different peripheral blood mononuclear subtypes, such as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte to leukocyte ratio (MWR), play an 
important role in predicting the prognosis of patients with various cancers.11–14 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) 
is a critical inflammatory-related protein synthesized by the liver and has been shown to affect patient survival in hepatocel-
lular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.15–17  The levels of serum albumin (ALB) intuitively reflect the nutritional 
status of individuals and have been confirmed to be an effective tool for predicting the outcomes of patients with gastric cancer 
and haematological malignancy.18,19 The inflammation-immunity-nutrition score (IINS), which reflects hs-CRP, lymphocytes 
(LYM), and ALB, is considered a superior prognostic evaluation system indicator.12,20,21 However, the relationship between 
IINS and the prognosis of patients with ENKTL has not been further explored.

Therefore,  the  aim  of  our  study  was  to  develop  a  new  nomogram  model  based  on  the  IINS  score  and  traditional 
clinical indicators and to evaluate the performance of the evaluation system in predicting the prognosis of patients with 
ENKTL.  Additionally,  we  further  compared  the  prognosis  predictive  ability  of  the  nomogram  model  with  traditional 
prognostic systems, including PINK, IPI, and KPI systems.

Materials and Methods
Patients
The clinical and laboratory data of 435 consecutive patients diagnosed with ENKTL at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center 
(SYSUCC)  between  January  2017  and  October  2021  were  retrospectively  collected.  The  eligible  patients  were  defined  as 
follows: 1) histological and pathological confirmation of ENKTL; 2) newly diagnosed; and 3) complete clinicopathological and 
follow-up data. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) complications with other malignancies; 2) definite evidence of 
infection; and 3) lost to follow-up. The last follow-up date was April 18, 2023, and the overall survival (OS) was calculated as the 
time span from the diagnosis of ENKTL to the last follow-up or patient death. The study was carried out in accordance with 
the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments and approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of SYSUCC.

Study Variables and Cutoff Value Calculation
We obtained the baseline clinicopathological parameters of patients, such as age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, and haematological 
parameters,  including  hs-CRP,  ALB,  and  LYM.  According  to  receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve  analysis,  we 
determined the  optimal cutoff value for  each  indicator associated with OS and  grouped each  parameter as  follows:  hs-CRP 
score =0 (≤10.1 mg/L) and score=1 (>10.1 mg/L), ALB score=0 (>41.1 g/L) and score=1 (≤41.1 g/L), LYM score= 0 (>1.12×109/ 
L), score =1 (≤1.12×109/L). The IINS scores were defined as the sum of the hs-CRP, LYM, and ALB scores.12 The patients were 
then  allocated  to  three  groups  according  to  IINS  scores:  Low  IINS  (IINS=0),  medium  IINS  (IINS=1),  and  high  IINS 
(IINS=2 or 3).

Study Design and Statistical Analysis
The flowchart of this study is shown in Figure 1. All cases were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n=304) and 
validation cohort (n=131) at a ratio of 7:3. The Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to examine the balance 
of clinicopathological features and scores of several prognostic systems between the training cohort and the validation 
cohort. In the training cohort, a prognostic nomogram model was constructed by using univariate and multivariate Cox 
analyses  to  screen  variables  that  independently  related  to  OS.  ROC  curve  analysis  was  utilized  to  evaluate  the 
predictive  efficacy  of  the  nomogram.  The  performance  and  net  clinical  benefit  of  the  nomogram  were  evaluated  by

Results
Clinical Characteristics and Survival
The baseline clinical characteristics of all 435 patients are summarized in Table 1. In the total population, the median age was 
46 (range 7~83) years, and 67.8% were male. The majorities of the patients were in the early stage (stage I/II) (72.4%) and 
exhibited good status according to  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  Performance Status  (ECOG  PS) assessment 
(93.3%). Eighty-one percent (81.4%) of individuals had nasal cavity or adjacent tissue invasion. Only a few patients presented 
distal  lymph  node  involvement  (12.4%),  bone  marrow  (4.1%),  or  B  symptoms  (34.5%).  Baseline  characteristics  were 
balanced between the two groups.

The  median  follow-up  times  in  the  training  cohort  and  validation  cohort  were  51.9  months  (95%  CI:  47.9–56.0 
months) and 47.8 months (95% CI: 44.7–51.0 months), respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 84.2%, 70.5%, 
and 62.6% in the training group and 81.7%, 71.5%, and 67.1% in the validation group, respectively.

Univariate and Multivariate Cox Analysis
Cox  univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and the results are presented in Table 2. Univariate analysis 
revealed that high IINS scores (IINS=2 or 3) had a significant influence on OS, with high hazard ratios (HR=2.093, 95%

stage (HR=2.945, 95% CI: 1.992–4.353, p<0.001) were associated with OS of patients. Then, we included variables with 
p<  0.05  for  Cox  multivariate  analysis  and  observed  that  age  (HR=1.862,  95%  CI:  1.170–2.965,  p=  0.009),  ECOG  PS 
(HR=2.857,  95%  CI:  1.537–5.313,  p=0.001),  Ann  Arbor  stage  (HR=2.189,  95%  CI:  1.310–3.656,  p=0.003),  bone 
marrow  involvement  (HR=2.587,  95%  CI:  1.172–5.710,  p=0.019),  and  IINS  (HR=1.429,  95%  CI:  1.051–1.943, 
p=0.023) were still significant independent factors of OS.

Construction of the Nomogram and Model Performance
In the training cohort, the prognostic nomogram was constructed according to the selected variables (Figure 2). The risk 
rating of each variable was assigned a corresponding point, which provides a visual representation of the scores for each 
risk  factor.  Larger  points  suggested  a  higher  probability  of  death.  By  adding  the  scores  for  all  risk  factors,  we  could 
calculate the survival probability of patients at different time points. We observed that IINS had a greater impact on OS 
than  ECOG  PS,  bone  marrow  involvement,  and  Ann  Arbor  stage.  The  constructed  nomogram  model  based  on  the 
selected factors showed superior accuracy in predicting the OS rate of patients, with a C-index of 0.733 (95% CI: 0.684– 
0.781).  The  calibration  curves  revealed  good  performance  in  predicting  the  1-,  3-  and  5-year  OS  of  patients  in  this 
population (Figure 3A–C). Moreover, the C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction in the validation cohort was 0.759 
(95% CI: 0.680–0.838), and the calibration curves showed good agreement between 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival 
probabilities predicted by the nomogram and actual observation (Figure 3D–F).

Comparison Performances of the Nomogram
Then, we compared the predictive ability of the nomogram with the PINK, IPI, and KPI models in terms of the C-index and 
AUC. In the training cohort, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.733 (95% CI: 0.684–0.781), which indicated better performance 
than that of the PINK, IPI, and KPI systems, with values of 0.636 (95% CI: 0.584–0.688), 0.681 (95% CI: 0.630–0.732), and 
0.693 (95% CI: 0.640–0.747), respectively. Similarly, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.759 (95% CI: 0.680–0.838), higher 
than that of the PINK (0.737, 95% CI: 0.662–0.811), IPI (0.707, 95% CI: 0.629–0.785) and KPI (0.639, 95% CI: 0.551–0.727) 
(Table 3). In addition, the established nomogram had the largest AUC in predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year OS compared to the PINK, 
IPI and KPI systems, both in the training cohort (Figure 4A–C) and the validation cohort (Figure 4D–F). The results suggested 
that compared with traditional  prognostic systems, the  nomogram  model  presented a trend  of  superior  predictive  capability. 
Moreover, DCA showed that the nomogram appeared to yield the most significant net benefit in terms of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS

compared  to  the  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI  prognostic  systems  in  both  the  training  cohort  (Figure  5A–C)  and  validation  cohort 
(Figure 5D–F), which indicated that the nomogram may has good clinical application value.

Discrimination Ability of the Prognostic Nomogram
First, we assigned patients to three groups according to IINS scores and found that patients with high IINS scores had significantly 
worse 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS than those with low IINS in both the training and validation cohorts (Figure 6A and B). Then, the 
patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median nomogram scores. The results showed that in 
the training cohort, the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 93%, 89%, and 85% in the low-risk group and 75%, 60%, and 54% in the 
high-risk group, respectively (p < 0.001). In the validation cohort, patients in the high-risk group had lower 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS 
rates (67%, 53%, and 49%) than those in the low-risk group (93%, 92%, and 89%) (p<0.001) (Figure 6C and D). The constructed 
nomogram showed significant differences in OS between the different risk groups, reflecting the good discriminative efficacy of 
the model in predicting patient prognosis. The results indicated that the new prognostic nomogram model might be a useful tool 
for predicting the survival of patients with ENKTL.

Discussion
Here,  we  established  a  new  nomogram  model  based  on  IINS  scores  to  predict  the  prognosis  of  ENKTL  patients.  We 
showed  that  IINS  scores  were  a  significant  prognostic  factor  for  OS  and  that  patients  with  high  IINS  scores  had 
significantly poorer outcomes than those with low IINS scores. In addition, for the first time, we combined IINS scores 
with  several  traditional  clinical  parameters  that  were  independently  associated  with  patient  prognosis  to  determine  the 
prognostic value of the new nomogram in patients with ENKTL. Our results suggested that the new nomogram appears 
to  exhibit  superior  performance  compared  to  the  traditional  prognostic  systems  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI,  which  provides 
important reference value for personalized treatment of ENKTL patients.

ENKTL,  as  a  haematological  malignancy  originating  from  mature  NK  cells  or  cytotoxic  T cells  (CTLs),  exhibits 
obvious  heterogeneity  in  clinical  manifestations  and  prognosis.1,2  Although  patients  with  early-stage  ENKTL  exhibit 
a  good  prognosis  after  treatment  with  standard  radiotherapy  or  combination  chemotherapy,  patients  with  advanced 
disease  often  present  dismal  outcomes,  with  a  5-year  survival  rate  of  approximately  70%.22,23  To  identify  patients’ 
prognostic  risks  more  accurately,  researchers  have  gradually  explored  the  prognostic  value  of  the  PINK,  IPI  and  KPI 
prognostic  systems  in  ENKTL  patients.  However,  these  models  failed  to  accurately  delineate  risk  among  different 
populations or  to distinguish high-risk  groups among  early-stage patients.24,25  Previous studies have  demonstrated that 
systemic  inflammation  affects  the  occurrence  and  development  of  tumours  by  inducing  gene  mutations,  inhibiting  cell 
apoptosis, inducing angiogenesis, and activating abnormal inflammatory signalling pathways.9,10  A growing number of 
studies  have  illustrated  the  diagnostic  and  prognostic  values  of  inflammatory  markers,  such  as  LMR,  NLR,  systemic 
immune-inflammatory index (SII) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), in various cancers.26–29 Recently, a study found 
that the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), an inflammation-based prognostic evaluation system comprising measures of 
C-reactive  protein  and  albumin,  showed  significant  prognostic  value  in  ENKTL.30  However,  the  prognostic  system  is

addition, the sample size of this study was limited. In another study. Scholars analysed the prognostic predictive value of 
the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score reflecting albumin, serum total cholesterol, and absolute lymphocytes 
and created a workable nomogram model for personalized assessment. The results showed that the CONUT score was 
more efficient in predicting ENKTL prognosis than the IPI, KPI and PINK models.13 However, this study mainly focused 
on the impact of nutritional status on patient prognosis, while the impact of inflammation and immune status on patient 
prognosis  was  not  further  investigated.  ENKTL  is  a  distinct  subtype  of  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  frequently

inflammatory response syndrome caused by uncontrolled overactivation of lymphocytes and macrophages.32  Therefore, 
we  needed  to  explore  a  more  comprehensive  prognostic  system  that  could  reflect  the  inflammatory,  immune,  and 
nutritional status of patients to predict the survival of patients more accurately.

Recently, the IINS score, which is derived from hs-CRP, ALB, and lymphocyte LYM, has been reported as a strong clinical 
prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.20 A high IINS score represents reduced lymphocytes, hypoproteinae-
mia, and high hs-CRP, which often indicates high systemic inflammation and low immune function and nutritional status. At 
present, there have been no studies describing the prognostic effect of the IINS scoring system in ENKTL. In our study, the results 
revealed that patients with high IINS scores experienced a relatively shorter overall survival time than those with low IINS scores 
and demonstrated that IINS was a practical and effective prognostic indicator, which is consistent with those observed in some 
kinds of tumours12,21  Furthermore, in addition to IINS, traditional prognostic factors such as age, ECOG performance status, 
bone marrow involvement, and Ann Arbor stage have also been confirmed to be important factors affecting the prognosis of 
patients  with  ENKTL  and  have  been  included  in  several  traditional  prognostic  models,  such  as  the  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI. 
Therefore, we constructed and validated a new nomogram model based on both IINS and independent prognostic indicators and 
compared the  predictive  effect  of this  model with that of  the traditional prognostic systems  PINK,  IPI, and  IPI. The results 
showed that compared with the PINK, IPI and KPI models, the C-index and AUC values of the IINS-based nomogram were 
higher, indicating that the nomogram may have more powerful predictive efficacy and better identify prognostic risks in patients

with ENKTL. Our results provide insight into the relationship between inflammation, nutrition, and immunity and the survival of 
ENKTL patients.

However, this study has some limitations. Firstly, although the nomogram tending to have improved predictive 
power,  it  was  not  statistically  significant  enough,  possibly  due  to  the  limited  numbers  in  these  cohorts.  Further 
study  of  this  nomogram  in  larger  multi-institutional  studies  is  necessary  to  definitively  establish  the  effectiveness 
of  this  nomogram  in  comparison  to  other  established  predictive  models  commonly  used  in  clinical  practice. 
Secondly,  we  excluded  ENKTL  patients  with  clear  infections  in  our  study,  which  might  be  a  limitation  of  the 
prognostic  scoring  system.  However,  this  exclusion  ensured  that  our  observation  and  analysis  of  inflammation 
primarily focused on processes related to the tumor-associated inflammation, avoiding interference from infection- 
induced  inflammation.  This  approach  helped  to  reduce  the  impact  of  external  factors  on  the  study  results,  leading 
to  a  more  accurate  assessment  of  the  characteristics  and  effects  of  tumor-related  inflammation.  Furthermore, 
different treatment regimens were included in the study, possibly impacting the survival of patients to some extent.
In  summary,  we  first  established  and  validated  a  new  nomogram  based  on  the  IINS  score  and  traditional  prognostic 
indicators and evaluated the prognostic value of the nomogram in ENKTL patients. Our findings suggest that IINS may act as 
a strong prognostic predictor in patients with ENKTL. Specifically, IINS combined with traditional prognostic factors presents 
better  prognostic  performance  than  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI,  possibly  providing  an  easy  way  to  identify  patients  with  a  poor 
prognosis and an opportunity to guide treatment and follow-up strategies to improve the outcomes of ENKTL patients.
