Abstract: Mitochondria are organelles with highly dynamic ultrastructure maintained by
ﬂexible fusion and ﬁssion rates governed by Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases)
is crucial for
dependent proteins. Balanced control of mitochondrial quality control
maintaining cellular energy and metabolic homeostasis; however, dysfunction of the
dynamics of fusion and ﬁssion causes loss of integrity and functions with the accumula-
tion of damaged mitochondria and mitochondrial deoxyribose nucleic acid (mtDNA) that
can halt energy production and induce oxidative stress. Mitochondrial derived reactive
oxygen species (ROS) can mediate redox signaling or, in excess, causing activation of
inﬂammatory proteins and further exacerbate mitochondrial deterioration and oxidative
stress. ROS have a deleterious effect on many cellular components, including lipids,
proteins, both nuclear and mtDNA and cell membrane lipids producing the net result of
the accumulation of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) capable of activating
pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface and in the cytoplasm of immune
cells. Chronic inﬂammation due to oxidative damage is thought to trigger numerous
chronic diseases including cardiac, liver and kidney disorders, neurodegenerative diseases
(Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease), cardiovascular diseases/atherosclerosis,
obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Keywords: mitochondria, dynamics, inﬂammation, non-communicable diseases

Introduction
Mitochondria are one of the cell organelles that are characterized as round, bean-like,
seen as an oval shape under the electron microscope.1 They contain a dynamic
branched network that constantly fuses and divide under the control of speciﬁc fusion
and ﬁssion machinery2 which is consistent with the endosymbiotic theory of bacterial
ancestor evolution.3 By nature, mitochondria are a highly ﬂexible ultrastructure orga-
nelle designed to regulate the bioenergetics ﬂux of key molecular elements.2,4
Mitochondrial proteomics depict that around 1200 proteins are encoded in the nuclear
genome with only 13 of them being coded in the maternally inherited mitochondrial
genome.5 The overall dynamic nature of mitochondria is governed by Guanosine
Triphosphatases (GTPases) dependent antagonist activities called fusion and ﬁssion.
Bidirectional crosstalk between mitochondria and the nucleus is strictly controlled by
different signaling pathways and with the dynamic fusion and ﬁssion nature of
mitochondria.6 Fusion proteins can be found in outer membrane mitofusins (Mfn1 &
Mfn2) and inner membrane optic atrophy 1 (Opa 1). Fission proteins (Dynamin related

protein 1 (Drp1)) with other proteins mediate the mitochon-
drial ultrastructure process.7,8 So, balanced control of mito-
chondrial dynamics is very important which, if not balanced,
can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dys-
function is a condition characterized by loss of membrane
potential to decrease Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) produc-
tion, decrease respiration or oxidative phosphorylation lead-
ing to a metabolic shift to the glycolysis dependent ATP
generation that
takes place outside mitochondria which
increases the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS).4,9,10 Uncontrolled production of ROS can
further damage/distract the mitochondrial membrane and its
major constitutes like DNA, lipids, and proteins.11 These
fragments can initiate mitophagy to promote cell survival
or can induce the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis.12,13 Initially, this condition can be regulated by
mitochondrial fusion/ﬁssion activities. Fusion delays the
onset of apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation
while ﬁssion has a positive role in apoptosis.14,15 However,
the failure of such quality control can contribute to the
development of degenerative diseases like type 2 diabetes,
cancer, cardiovascular disorders, neuropathies such as
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease and age-related
disorders.12,16–20 Mitochondrial dysfunctions play a central
role in chronic inﬂammation through activation of signaling
pathways, including mitochondrial calcium handling ROS
production and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
kB).21 Damaged mitochondria and degraded mtDNA pro-
duce an accumulation of Danger Associated Molecular
Patterns (DAMPs) which can bind and activate membrane
or cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to
stimulate inﬂammatory responses.22,23 Mitochondrial quality
control failure with the downregulation of mitophagy results
in spontaneous inﬂammasomes activation as a consequence
of mitochondrial ROS burst.24 Oxidative stress due to ROS
burst also damages endothelial cells, which are recognized
factors for atherosclerosis; decreased nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis contributes to hypertension, upregulates the secre-
tion of adhesion molecules and inﬂammatory cytokines, and
is responsible for the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins.25
Muscle cell mitochondrial dysfunctions lead to a reduction in
fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of glucose transport,
which is an indication of insulin resistance, and further
results in obesity.26 Obesity increases the likelihood of var-
ious diseases, particularly atheromatous heart disease, type 2
diabetes, breathing difﬁculties during sleep, certain types
of cancer, osteoarthritis and chronic periodontitis.27,28
However, the exact molecular mechanism of mitochondrial

dysfunction and its association with this chronic non-
communicable disease is not fully addressed. Therefore,
this review aims to describe mitochondrial dynamic dysfunc-
tions as the main determinant factors for inﬂammatory-
related non-communicable diseases.

Mitochondrial Dynamics and
Functions
to life. They generate Adenosine
Mitochondria are vital
Triphosphate (ATP) by the breakdown of fuels (i.e., glucose,
amino acids, and fatty acids) through a series of redox reac-
tions performed by a set of ﬁve electron transport chain (ETC)
enzyme complexes of the mammalian OXPHOS system.29,30
To control the required maintenance of mitochondrial mor-
phology in a dynamic environment, mitochondria continu-
ously undergo tightly regulated and opposite remodeling
process called fusion and ﬁssion activities.31–33 Fusion and
ﬁssion activity of the mitochondria is regulated by the coordi-
nated action of the series well-conserved GTPases proteins.
These are mitofusins(Mfn1 & Mfn2) transmembrane GTPases
embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane, Optic atro-
phy1 (OPA) is a dynamin-related GTPases associated with the
mitochondrial inner membrane or intermembrane space.34–36
Proper balance of the antagonist activities of fusion and ﬁssion
is crucial for fundamental mitochondrial integrity and func-
tioning including energy metabolism, ROS generation, and
apoptosis regulation.35,37 Fission promotes the removal of
damaged mitochondria by mitophagy to maintain proper
assembly of electron transport chain complexes. This can
allow mitochondria to exchange lipid membranes, and intra-
mitochondrial contents while fusion escapes autophagy-
mediated destruction to maintain proper mitochondrial
ultrastructure and elongation (Figure 1).23,35,38 Fusion allows
for mitochondrial interconnection, favoring mtDNA mixing,
signal transmission and exchange of metabolites with in-
network. On the other hand, ﬁssion ensures equal organelle
segregation between daughter cells and target defective mito-
chondria for their subsequent removal through mitophagy.39,40
The dynamic process controls mitochondrial morphology,
biogenesis, transportation and localization, quality control
and degradation, and apoptotic cell deaths.35,41,42

Mitochondria are integral to normal cellular function as
they are responsible for energy production through oxidative
phosphorylation; they synthesize key molecules including the
phospholipids and Heme, calcium homeostasis, apoptotic acti-
vation, and cell death.43–45 Mitochondria have a unique feature
of semi-autonomous in which exactly 13 proteins used in ATP

fusion and ﬁssion machinery,

production through oxidative phosphorylation are coded by its
mtDNA. The remaining 1200–1500 mitochondrial proteins
are nuclear gene products that are imported into the
organelle.5,46,47 The maintenance of mtDNA is important for
normal and efﬁcient functioning as it codes proteins for oxi-
dative phosphorylation of ATP production from oxidation of
sugar, fats, and proteins, as well as tRNAs and ribosomal
RNAs that are needed for their translation in the mitochondrial
matrix.48 As the principal functions of mitochondria are to
synthesize ATP from the oxidation of sugar, fat, and proteins
through the process of OXPHOS via endosymbiotic principle.
Electrons from reduced equivalents are transported along the
respiratory chain protein complex to generate electrochemical
proton gradient or membrane potential (ΔΨm) across the inner
mitochondrial membrane producing ATP.10,27,48 Under normal
conditions, 1–2% of electrons can leak from electron transport
chain and reduced to superoxide radical there by producing
reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will be detoxiﬁed by
the action of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismu-
tase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.49,50 However, when
the production of ROS overrides the capability of antioxidants,

oxidative stress will damage cellular macromolecules (i.e.
DNA, lipids and proteins). This is linked to multiple patholo-
gical conditions such as: neurodegenerative diseases; diabetes;
cancer; and premature aging.29,51 The damaged mitochondria
with cellular stress are removed by selective mitochondrial
autophagy called mitophagy otherwise damaged mitochondria
accumulated and induce mitochondrion mediated cell death.52
Fusion and ﬁssion regulate mitochondrial damage and repair
antagonistically; fusion enriches damaged mitochondria with
normal genome and proteins to escape mitochondria from
damage while ﬁssion, in contrast, destined damaged mito-
chondria for destruction by mitophagy.31,53,54 Alteration of
normal mitochondrial function results in signaling distur-
bance, energy-dependent disturbance, and genetic defects of
the mitochondrial genome.

are associated with metabolic dysfunction or disease.55 The
to remove
impairment of mitochondrial quality control
damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria leads to the accu-
mulation of damage associated with membrane patterns
(DAMPs) released from injured cells, cell-free mtDNA,
N-formyl peptides and Cardiolipin.56 Mitochondrial DAMPs
can bind and activate membrane or cytosolic pathogen recog-
nition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLR), nod
like receptors (NLRs), like those recognized by pathogen-
associated molecular pattern (PAMPs).57 Thus, it activates
different early-phase inﬂammatory mediators like tumor
necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukins, interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ) and ROS/RNS.23 These coexistences of cellular
responses to danger of oxidative stress and accumulation of
inﬂammation.23

Mitochondrial
5-lipoxygenase are the major cellular sources of ROS
production.58 The byproducts of oxidative stress: ROS; and
RNS can also further generated because of inﬂammatory cell
activity.59,60 Surprisingly, oxidative stress activates several
transcription factors (NF-kB and activated protein 1) leading
to the production and activation of pro-inﬂammatory cyto-
kines, chemokines, and lymphocytes which in turn leads to
the production of more ROS and RNS, principally in the form
of superoxide, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite.61–63 This
self-amplifying and the self-
complicated bidirectional
sustaining relationship between the development of chronic
oxidative stress and chronic systemic inﬂammations outcomes
to modiﬁcation of DNA, tertiary protein structure, and lipid
peroxidation of the cell membrane. This further results in a net
accumulation of DAMPs that can further exacerbate the
conditions.64–66 Thus, in turn, it will have a deleterious effect
of damaging mitochondria synergistically leading to the deple-
tion of ATP production and promoting a switch to anaerobic
glycolysis.67 Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction with ﬁs-
sion upregulation prevents the elimination of damaged mito-
chondria producing ROS and RNS that exceed the antioxidant
activity is likely initiating factors in inﬂammation, aging, and
age-related diseases (Figure 2).44

Mitochondrial Dysfunction and
Signaling Pathway in Inﬂammation
Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that contain
different proteins used for biosynthesis, metabolism and
cell death or survival functions.68 The vast majority of
proteins are encoded in the nucleus and imported to

mitochondria after translated. Translated proteins were
shared with end-to-end collision fashion of mitochondrial
fusion movement along the cytoskeleton.2,34 Each fusion
movement of mitochondria is mediated by outer mem-
brane proteins Mfn 1 and 2 and inner membrane with
OPA1 catalyzed by dedicated GTPases.69–71 Since this
continuous fusion of individual mitochondria may produce
abnormally elongated mitochondria
that were non-
functional, an opposing process called ﬁssion becomes
available.32 The ﬁssion process prevents abnormal elonga-
tion of mitochondria by splitting a single mitochondrion
into two separate organelles.72 If the balance favors ﬁs-
sion, mitochondria become fragmented, small spherical
organelle while if fusion is favored, elongated and banded
together mitochondria will be formed.35 Mitochondrial
dynamics imbalance affects energy production, apoptosis,
mitophagy, mitochondrial movement, mtDNA stability
and the tolerance of cells to mtDNA mutations.73–75 The
abnormalities of dynamics dysfunction and bidirectional
signaling pathway between mitochondria and nucleus are
exposed to, constantly alter physiological, environmental
and pathological stimuli.2,6 As the center for many cellular
functions, especially in energy supply with oxidative meta-
bolism, maintaining mitochondrial quality control is cru-
cial for tissue homeostasis.23,39 Mitochondrial dysfunction
with the release of ROS and mitochondrial-derived
DAMPs contribute to initiating an inﬂammatory response
by invoking pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that interact with
receptors like those involved in the pathogen-associated
response.76 Mitochondria play a central role in sterile
inﬂammation through the activation of several pathways.21

Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling and
ROS Derived Inﬂammation
Mitochondrial energy generation in the inner membrane
through the electron transport chain by using oxygen as an
electron acceptor is the major source of ROS generation.77
ROS are produced by one-electron transfer from redox donor
NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen in mitochondrial
ETC especially from complex I and complex III.78 A redox-
sensitive inﬂammatory signaling pathway engages mitochon-
drial calcium handling, ROS production, and nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) activation.79 The activation of NF-kB provokes the
transcription of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,
IL1, IL6, and IL8.77 Under calcium overloads, such as burn
injury or sepsis, the electron transport chain (ETC) becomes
dysfunctional and elevated ROS generation occurs. Such

Mitochondrial- DAMPs Derived
Inﬂammation
Due to the “bacterial ancestor” theory of mitochondria, the
releasing of contents due to damage or dysfunction to
cytoplasm provokes an immunological response. In addi-
tion to mitochondrial dysfunction with oxidative stress,
several conditions characterized by an inﬂammatory
response (e.g., trauma, HIV, cancer) are associated with
increased levels of circulating mitochondrial DAMPs.

DAMPs,
release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like IL1B and
IL18 which ﬁnally leads to sterile inﬂammation.58 In par-
ticular, mitochondrial DNA activates different inﬂamma-
tory responses through different receptors, (Figure 2)
triggering transcription and translation of inﬂammatory
cytokines. Uncontrolled and excessive release of mito-
chondrial DAMPs associated with severity and contributes
to the dysregulated process observed in numerous inﬂam-
matory and autoimmune conditions.44

in turn,

Mitochondrial Dysfunctions
Associated Non-Communicable
Diseases
(NCDs) are increasingly
Non-communicable diseases
becoming the leading public causes of morbidity and mor-
tality globally.82 The leading NCDs encompass a cluster of
illness including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes
mellitus type 2, chronic obstructive lung disease, and
cancer. These NCDs have common and key modiﬁable
behavioral risk factors like unhealthy diet, lack of physical
activity, the harmful use of alcohol, tobacco use and which
in turn leads to overweight and obesity, raised blood
pressure, and raised cholesterol, and ultimately disease.83
Cardiovascular diseases accounted for most NCD deaths
(17.5 million NCD deaths), followed by cancers (8.2mil-
lion NCD deaths), respiratory diseases (4.0 million NCD
deaths) and diabetes mellitus (1.5million NCD deaths).84
Globally, CVDs being the largest contributor to global
mortality, accounting for nearly half of 36 million annual
NCDs deaths and produces immense health and economic
burdens.85

A common feature of all NCDs is excessive fatigue which
results from mitochondrial function impairment; the crucial
organelle responsible for cellular energy production.86 As
stated above, defects in mitochondrial gene results mutation
of proteins that involve mitochondrial dynamic activities then
proceed to its physiological activity impairment.34,35 The
mitochondrial genome is susceptible to oxidative damage as
a result of its residence close to the electron transport system,
mtDNA lacks histone protein (protects from damage), and
repair mechanism rather it Induces to apoptosis once it
becomes damaged.87,88 Thus, lack of repair mechanism of
damaged mtDNA means cells cannot copy mtDNA accurately
resulting in errors of transcription, deletions and mutations and
also oxidation from ROS results in a series of cellular abuse;
loss of membranes integrity, diminishing proton gradient caus-
ing less ATP production, unfolding and loss of cellular protein
afﬁnity for their respective enzymes, and releasing cyto-
chromes C into the cytosol stimulating apoptosis, all in
a continuous feed-forward cycle of cellular, tissue and organ
dysfunction to cause chronic diseases.87 Additionally, high
ROS concentration permits histone acetylation to predomi-
nate, which accelerates faulty nuclear transcription and thus
replication. This initiates the release of NF-kB into the nucleus
(a signiﬁcant pro-inﬂammatory cytokine which also damages
nDNA). Simultaneously, cell differentiation and apoptosis
signals are silenced with histone acetylation, eventually result-
ing in over-replication favoring tumorigenesis.89,90 As the
mitochondrial inner membrane is the main site of electron
transport chain, dwelling different enzymes and proteins
which are also becomes the main source of oxidative stress.
Enzymes and proteins (i.e. cytochrome c), and low-molecular-
weight redox intermediates (i.e. coenzymes such as ubiqui-
none or coenzyme Q) that transport reducing equivalents, in
the form of hydrogen atoms or just their electrons, down the
redox potential from respiratory substrates to oxygen: an
oxidative pathway composed of four multiple-subunit com-
plexes in the mitochondria which leaks 0.2–2% electrons to
molecular oxygen producing super oxide or hydrogen
peroxide.27 These enzymes and proteins are the primary tar-
gets of oxidative stress products like ROS and RNS, and it is
not surprising that disruption of function and structure of
mitochondria are now thought to trigger numerous diseases,
including cardiac, liver and kidney disorders, and neurodegen-
erative diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease), aging processes and multiple organ failure in septic
shock. Cardiovascular disease/atherosclerosis, obesity and
type 2 diabetes are closely associated with chronic inﬂamma-
tion characterized by abnormal cytokine production, increased

levels of acute-phase reactants and activation of a network of
inﬂammatory signaling pathways.91 Mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion because of unbalanced fusion and ﬁssion, genetic defects
of mtDNA or oxidative damage with ROS and RNS can
impair energy metabolism, the central alteration in obesity.8
Cells can manage nutrient supply by increasing mitochondrial
contents. However, persistent nutrient leftover devastates the
mitochondrial system and causes its dysfunction leading to the
accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid products to cause
fat accumulation and oxidative stress which damage endothe-
lial cells.92,93 Obesity is key in the development of major non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, cardiovascular disease and several classes of cancer
including colorectal,
liver, breast, pancreatic endometrial,
lymphoma and myoma.8,27 Dysfunctional
renal, prostate,
mitochondria create a vicious cycle of
impaired beta-
oxidation giving rise to the production of ceramides, free
radicals and inﬂammatory cytokines which damages the mito-
chondrial membrane (as shown in Figure 3) and DNA further

jeopardizes mitochondrial respiratory capacity.94 Oxygen-free
radicals may themselves initiate a chronic inﬂammatory pro-
cess in which the pathology is characteristics of obesity and
linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.95

Therefore, preventing chronic sterile inﬂammation
derived with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxida-
tive stress and DAMPs activated inﬂammasome can signiﬁ-
cantly diminish non-communicable diseases.97,98 Reducing
cellular and mitochondrial membrane and DNA damage and
loss of membrane integrity is important in preventing loss of
cellular energy and regulating cellular life span.99 Since
oxidative stress is the consequence of imbalance between
pro- and antioxidants species, supplements containing diet-
ary antioxidants and some accessory molecules, such as zinc
and certain vitamins, are important in maintaining free-
radical scavenging systems, biosynthetic capacity, mem-
branes, enzymes and DNA.100 Utility of oral mitochondrial

mitochondrial supplements also improves mitochondrial
function.86 Anaerobic and resistance training intervention
induced in a mouse model showed an increase in the activa-
tion of the signaling pathway involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis.101 Preclinical evidence from animal and in vitro
studies suggested that regular endurance-based exercise
intervention is known to be a potent stimulus for muscle
mitochondrial biogenesis.102 It is also shown that endurance-
based exercise increases muscle oxidation capacity of mito-
chondria by increasing the activity of citrate synthase and
respiratory chain complexes.103–105

Conclusion
Mitochondria are central to the regulation of energy metabo-
lism and cellular homeostasis due to their principal role in
bioenergetics, ROS production, ion homeostasis, apoptosis
and signal transduction. This organelle is highly dynamic and
can re-program itself depending on various environmental
and intracellular signals important for multiple mitochondrial
functions, including mtDNA stability, respiratory function,
apoptosis, response to cellular stress, and mitochondrial
degradation. The dynamic process of mitochondria may not
be balanced as a result of proteins required for fusion and
ﬁssion that decreases the crucial role of mitochondria bioe-
nergetics and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria
producing ROS.ROS generated by dysfunctional mitochon-
dria further damage mitochondrial of different organs and
tissues that cannot function properly to result in chronic and
age-related disorders. Non-communicable diseases that are
increasing worldwide in recent years are the consequences of
unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, which shares basic
mechanisms of mitochondrial defects, systemic inﬂamma-
tion, and oxidative stress. Consequent oxidative stress caus-
ing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress
leads to excess accumulation of food energy favoring obesity
and the development of other metabolic syndrome and
related complications. Maintaining the health of mitochon-
dria is very valuable and could aid in the prevention of age-
related disorders.
