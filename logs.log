Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and is regarded as an important mechanism in disease pathogenesis. One of the key pathogenetic 
mechanisms  of  IR  progression  is  impaired  free  fatty  acid  (FFA)  metabolism.  Plasminogen-
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and key inflammation markers, ie, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP), also play a role.
Purpose: To assess the changing levels of the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, 
CRP and PAI-1 and their association with the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
in myocardial infarction (MI) patients during their hospital stay.
Methods: The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included 95 nondiabetic MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 40 diabetic MI patients. The control group consisted of 30 sex- 
and age-matched volunteers. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels as well as FFA, glucose, C-peptide, 
insulin, and plasma PAI-1 concentrations were measured at days 1 and 12 from MI onset.
Results: At day 1, there was an increase in glucose concentrations, which remained high in both 
groups by day 12 but was much higher in the diabetic patients. Basal insulin and C-peptide levels 
did not differ significantly from those in the control group. The quantitative insulin sensitivity-
check index in both groups was significantly different from that in controls. FFA concentrations 
at day 1 in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients increased; by day 12, they had decreased but 
were still higher than the controls. CRP and IL-6 levels at day 1 were higher in all the patients, 
but diabetic patients had the highest levels; by day 12, the levels were lower but still 2.4-fold 
(IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than those in the control group.
Conclusion: This  study  showed  that  MI  is  accompanied  both  by  activated  inflammatory 
response and IR. Strong correlations between IL-6 and FFA concentrations demonstrate that 
nonspecific inflammation factors are involved in IR development in MI patients. Consequently, 
these inflammatory cytokines might cause the development of IR.
Keywords: insulin resistance, myocardial infarction, inflammation, type 2 diabetes mellitus

Introduction
Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes mel-
litus (T2DM), and is traditionally regarded as an important stage of its pathogenesis: 
IR in general and diabetic populations is associated with cardiovascular risk factors 
including hyperglycemia, dyslipoproteinemia, arterial hypertension, obesity, throm-
bosis, and smoking.1,2

Large clinical trials showed that IR was a predictor of such cardiovascular events 
as ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI).3,4 Additionally, it was estab-
lished that the course of MI as a separate disease is accompanied by IR development

and that the pathogenetic mechanisms are unclear. Medical 
literature has, among others, the following possible reasons 
for IR development: activation of local inflammation in the 
area of atherosclerotic lesion and infarct site with enhanced 
expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and acute-
phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP), as their 
key  representative.5 An  important  role  of  increased  CRP 
levels not only as an MI predictor and a marker of adverse 
outcome  but  also  as  a  precursor  of  IR  development  was 
established earlier.6 High CRP levels are thought to result 
in a change in insulin-action regulation at the cellular level, 
which could lead to IR.7

Among  proinflammatory  cytokines  contributing  to 
IR  development,  the  role  of  interleukin  (IL)-6,  which  has 
autocrine and paracrine properties and is involved in insulin 
reception and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism regulation, 
has been extensively studied. The increase in FFA concen-
trations in myocardial ischemia could also lead to a reduced 
sensitivity to insulin in the peripheral tissues.8,9 Moreover, 
previous experimental studies demonstrated that IL-6 could 
induce plasminogen-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 production. 
Its  activity  increase  is  regarded  both  as  a  risk  factor  for 
coronary atherothrombosis and MI and as a trigger for IR 
 development.10 PAI-1 is known to modulate insulin signal-
ing  in  fibroblasts,  preventing  vitronectin  binding  to  αvβ3-
receptors, which in turn decreases insulin-induced protein 
kinase B phosphorylation.11

According  to  Juhan-Vague  et  al,  obese  patients  with 
hyperinsulinemia  and  a  genotype  associated  with  the 
increased PAI-1 transcription had a high risk of MI.12 Thus, 
an analysis of the medical literature allows the suggestion that 
proinflammatory factors could be involved in IR development 
in acute coronary events. The detection of a possible associa-
tion between metabolic changes, indicators, and nonspecific 
inflammation markers in MI patients, including those with 
T2DM, can play a role in the choice of treatment strategy in 
terms of risk stratification in this category of patients.

This study was aimed at assessing the changing levels of 
the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, CRP and 
PAI-1,  and  their  association  with  presence  or  absence  of 
T2DM in MI patients during their hospital stay.

Materials and methods
Study subjects and design
A total of 155 MI patients (95 males and 60 females), mean 
age 65 ± 4.5 years, and 30 sex- and age-matched volunteers 
(the control group) with no cardiovascular or endocrine dis-
eases were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided 

into  two  groups:  group  I  comprised  95  nondiabetic  MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 60 diabetic MI patients. The 
mean T2DM duration was, on average, 6.4 ± 1.5 years. The 
groups were sex- and age-matched and had similar risk fac-
tors for ischemic heart disease, concurrent conditions, and 
MI complication rate.

The main demographic characteristics of the study patients 
are summarized in Table 1. The patient groups were similar in 
age, sex, main risk factors of ischemic heart disease, comor-
bidities, and coronary event incidence (Table 1). The study 
excluded patients older than 75 years and/or with clinically 
significant concurrent conditions (autoimmune diseases, thy-
roid gland, or adrenal gland diseases). However, there were 
more obese patients among those with T2DM compared to 
nondiabetic patients, according to body mass index (BMI) lev-
els: 29.65 (26.85–34.55) kg/m2 vs 25.5 (23.2–30.1) kg/m2.

Acute MI was diagnosed according to the 2007 Russian 
National  Cardiology  Society  guidelines  based  on  clinical, 
electrocardiographic,  echocardiographic,  and  biochemical 
signs of the disease. The inclusion criteria were chest pain 
refractory to nitroglycerin, myocardial ischemia, and necro-
sis  signs  (ST-segment  elevation  and/or  new  pathologic  Q 
waves on the electrocardiogram, elevated cardiac enzymes: 
MB fraction of creatine kinase [CK MB] and troponin T).

Insulin resistance and inflammation markers in MI

Peak CK MB and troponin T levels did not differ between 
the groups. Peak CK MB levels were 94.03 ± 17.9 U/L and 
137.64 ± 41.1 U/L in the diabetic and nondiabetic patients, 
respectively  (P  =  0.916);  troponin T  concentrations  were 
1.09 ± 0.92 ng/mL and 0.71 ± 0.41 ng/mL in the diabetic 
and nondiabetic patients, respectively (P = 0.564).

The  exclusion  criteria  were  age  .75  years,  clinically 
significant comorbidities (autoimmune diseases, thyroid or 
adrenal gland diseases), acute coronary syndrome as a com-
plication of percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary 
artery bypass surgery.

The patient groups had a similar incidence of major hos-
pital coronary events (Table 1). Eighty percent of patients 
in both groups did not have any signs of acute heart failure, 
according to the Killip classification (1967) upon admission 
and during the hospital stay (Table 1); however, more than 
50% of patients had arrhythmias and impaired conduction 
diagnosed according to the established criteria.13 The struc-
ture and function of the left ventricle did not differ between 
the  groups.  Mean  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  was 
51.25% ± 1.85% in the diabetic patients and 50.42% ± 1.62% 
in those without T2DM (P = 0.598); mean left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume was 164.35 ± 10.47 mL in the diabetic 
patients and 156.43 ± 7.18 mL in the nondiabetic patients 
(P = 0.649); mean left ventricular end-systolic volume was 
79.71 ± 8.32 mL in the diabetic patients and 75.22 ± 5.56 in 
the nondiabetic patients (P = 0.702).

The groups were similar in the presence/type of coronary 
artery  disease:  coronary  angiography  showed  multivessel 
(more  than  three  vessels)  hemodynamically  significant 
coronary artery lesions in both groups (76.5% in the diabetic 
patients and 62.5% in the nondiabetic patients [P = 0.857]). 
T2DM  compensation  was  evaluated  based  on  glycated 
hemoglobin  levels  (T2DM  was  considered  to  be  compen-
sated in glycated hemoglobin .7.5%, according to the 2000 
European Diabetes Policy Group criteria). Decompensated 
T2DM was diagnosed in eight (40%) patients.

The  study  design  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review Board of the Research Institute for Complex Issues 
of  Cardiovascular  Diseases;  all  the  individuals  signed  the 
informed consent before being enrolled in the study. Thera-
peutic interventions during the follow-up period are listed 
in Table 2.

Assays
Serum IL-6 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay at days 1 and 12 from the MI onset 
using Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) test-systems.

CRP,  serum  FFA,  and  glucose  concentrations  were  mea-
sured at the same study time points using standard Thermo 
Fisher Scientific (Vantaa, Finland) test systems on a Konelab 
30i  biochemistry  analyzer  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific  Oy, 
Vantaa, Finland). C-peptide and insulin concentrations were 
measured  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  with 
BioMedica (Waterloo, NSW, Australia) and Diagnostic Sys-
tems Laboratories (Webster, TX, USA) lab kits, respectively. 
Plasma  PAI-1  concentrations  were  assessed  with  standard 
Technoclone  (Vienna, Austria)  test  systems. Additionally, 
all the patients had their postprandial glycemia, insulin, and 
C-peptide concentrations measured 2 hours after a standard 
carbohydrate breakfast (75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved 
in 250–300 mL water to drink for 3–5 minutes on an empty 
stomach).

The IR level was estimated using a structural mathemati-
cal model incorporating fasting serum insulin and glucose 
measurement with the quantitative insulin sensitivity-check 
index (QUICKI) calculation. QUICKI  = 1/(log [I0] + log 
[G0]),  where  I0  –  basal  insulinemia  (mg/dL),  G0  –  basal 
glycemia  (mME/mL). According  to  Katz  et  al,  a  mean 
QUICKI  value  of  0.382  ±  0.007  correlates  with  normal 
tissue  sensitivity  to  insulin,  while  QUICKI  values  of 
0.331 ± 0.010 and 0.304 ± 0.007 correlate with moderate 
and severe IR.14

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney  test  for  unpaired  samples  and  the Wilcoxon  test 
for  paired  samples. The  results  were  presented  as  median 
and quartiles. P-values , 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated 
to analyze the correlations between the variables. The statis-
tical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, 
Tulsa, OK, USA).

Results
The  diabetic  and  nondiabetic  MI  patients  were  found  to 
have a 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold increase (respectively) in blood 
glucose  levels  at  day  1  compared  to  those  in  the  control 
group  (Table  3). The  increase  in  basal  glucose  levels  was 
still present at day 12 in both patient groups, but was more 
pronounced  in  the  diabetic  patients.  Postprandial  glucose 
concentrations were 2.6-fold increased in the individuals with 
MI and T2DM at day 12, while in the nondiabetic patients 
postprandial glucose levels decreased compared to the basal 
levels but did not reach those in the controls.

Unlike glucose concentrations, fasting serum insulin and 
C-peptide levels had a tendency towards increasing in both 
groups at days 1 and 12 after MI onset, but did not differ from 
those in the controls (Table 3). The change in postprandial 
levels of those parameters at day 12 was more significant. 
Indeed,  postprandial  insulin  concentrations  both  in  the 
diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients crept up in an almost 
similar way compared to the control and basal levels.

Despite the fact that the changes in glucose metabolism 
were less pronounced in the nondiabetic MI patients, the inte-
gral QUICKI of IR in both groups significantly differed from 
that in the controls. In the controls, the QUICKI value was 
0.38 ± 0.01 and corresponded to the normal tissue sensitiv-
ity to insulin. In the group of nondiabetic patients, QUICKI 
values were 0.316 ± 0.005 and 0.319 ± 0.005 at days 1 and 
12, respectively, which were regarded as borderline values 
between  severe  and  moderate  IR.  In  diabetic  MI  patients, 
QUICKI values were 0.296 ± 0.009 and 0.300 ± 0.005, which 
according to Katz et al corresponded to severe IR.14

Analysis of FFA concentration changes in MI patients 
showed significant differences compared to the controls both 
at day 1 and at day 12 of the disease (Table 4). At day 1, FFA 
concentrations in both diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients 
were seven- and elevenfold higher than those in the controls, 
respectively. By day 12, the levels had decreased, but were 
still three- and 4.7-fold higher than those in the controls; thus, 
in patients with such comorbidity, these changes were more 
pronounced during the entire follow-up period.

PAI-1 concentrations were found to be increased in both 
groups, but at the same time at day 1 the diabetic MI patients 
had  a  4.6-fold  increase  in  PAI-1  levels  compared  to  the 
 controls (Table 4). These values were, on average, twofold 
higher than those in the nondiabetic patients. At day 12 from 
MI onset, PAI-1 concentrations significantly decreased in both 
groups; however, they did not reach the control levels.

Measurement of the key inflammation markers showed 
that  at  day  1,  the  whole  study  population  had  3.6-  and

19-fold increased IL-6 and CRP concentrations, respectively 
(Table 5). At the same time, the diabetic patients had more 
pronounced changes in the levels of inflammation markers: 
IL-6  and  CRP  concentrations  were  5.3-fold  and  26-fold 
higher,  respectively  (Table  3). At  day  12,  IL-6  and  CRP 
concentrations had decreased in both groups, but were still 
on average 2.4-fold (IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than 
those in the controls, the diabetic MI patients having higher 
IL-6 and CRP levels during the entire follow-up period.

Correlation  analysis  demonstrated  the  correlations 
between CRP and FFA concentrations (R = 0.53, P = 0.04 for 
the  nondiabetic patients; R = 0.41, P = 0.03 for the diabetic 
patients) (Figure 1); CRP levels and CK MB activity (R = 0.42, 
P = 0.03 for the nondiabetic patients; R = 0.38, P = 0.027 for 
the diabetic patients). The diabetic MI patients had a positive 
correlation between CRP and PAI-1 concentrations (R = 0.5, 
P = 0.0027) and a negative one with QUICKI (R = –0.33, 
P  =  0.039). A  correlation  between  basal  glucose  and  IL-6 
levels  (R  =  0.48,  P  =  0.031  for  the  nondiabetic  patients;

correlations  between  CRP  and  postprandial  glucose  levels 
were found (R = 0.48, P = 0.045 for the nondiabetic patients; 
R = 0.51, P = 0.041 for the diabetic patients) (Figure 3).

In both groups, there were positive correlations between 
IL-6 and FFA concentrations (R = 0.12, P = 0.01; R = 0.49, 
P  =  0.005),  IL-6  and  PAI-1  concentrations  (R  =  0.47,

ure 5), and CRP concentrations and IL-6 levels (R = 0.29, 
P = 0.04; R = 0.38, P = 0.03) (Figure 6).

Discussion
According to the contemporary understanding, IR has been 
traditionally regarded as the key stage of T2DM  pathogenesis 
as  well  as  a  risk  factor  for  atherosclerosis  and  MI.15 The 
 well-established  IR  markers  are  glucose,  insulin,  and 
C- peptide  concentrations;  however,  according  to  medical 
literature, postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels are more 
informative than basal (fasting) ones, particularly when there 
are no obvious IR signs.16 This study shows that IR develops 
in MI patients, which is reflected by basal and postprandial 
hyperglycemia both in the acute and early recovery phases irre-
spective of T2DM presence. Indeed, the study demonstrated 
that both diabetic and nondiabetic patients had significantly 
increased glucose levels, while basal insulin concentrations 
did not differ significantly; however, there was a significant 
1.7-fold increase in postprandial insulin levels compared to 
those in the control groups, and the medical literature confirms 
that this parameter is a marker of IR. IR was also confirmed 
by lower QUICKI values. Diabetic MI patients had severe IR, 
and those without T2DM had moderate IR.

Among  other  IR  factors  in  MI,  such  proinflammatory 
cytokines and acute-phase proteins as IL-6 and CRP have been 
extensively studied in the medical literature.3 Recent research 
has shown that IL-6 has autocrine and paracrine properties 
along with its proinflammatory and cardiodepressive effects, 
and might be involved in IR development in MI patients.17 
A large prospective trial in 7735 nondiabetic males with no 
prediabetic conditions, conducted in the UK between 1978 and 
2005, showed a strong association between higher IL-6 levels 
and a risk of T2DM, irrespective of age and obesity.18

Some  authors  suggest  that  molecular  mechanisms 
of  mediated  IL-6  resistance  to  insulin  might  include  the 
 activation of proinflammatory serine/threonine stress kinases, 
protein  suppressors  of  cytokine  signaling,  and  protein 
tyrosine phosphatases acting as physiologic negative regula-
tors of insulin.2

IL-6 was also shown to increase FFA levels in the blood 
of male volunteers, which could induce resistance to periph-
eral tissue insulin. IL-6 is supposed to inhibit the activity of 
lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes, and on the contrary activate 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate-dependent  hormone-
 sensitive lipase in hepatocytes, which contributes to impaired 
circulating lipoprotein metabolism and FFA buildup inducing 
insulin-receptor dysfunction and IR development.15,19

The results of this study demonstrate higher IL-6 and FFA 
levels in the acute phase of MI and their further decrease in 
the early recovery period. Additionally, at day 1, the diabetic 
MI patients had the highest IL-6 and FFA concentrations, 
which could have been associated with profound metabolic 
changes  due  to  more  pronounced  IR  in  this  category  of

patients. The increased production of inflammation mediators 
seems to contribute to lipolysis activation accompanied by 
excess FFA release into the blood flow. The observed  positive 
correlation  between  IL-6  and  FFA  levels  confirms  this 
 suggestion. Reaching the liver, FFA on one hand becomes a 
substrate for triglyceride and atherogenic lipoprotein produc-
tion, and on the other hand causes the buildup of other lipid 
metabolites (ceramides, diacylglycerides), inducing impaired 
insulin signaling and thereby contributing to IR development 
to a much greater extent.16

According to reports of other authors, IL-6 is produced 
by different immune-system and adipose-tissue cells, as well 
as  endothelial  and  epithelial  cells.18  Experimental  studies 
showed that in MI, the main source of this cytokine is cardio-
myocytes, activated macrophages, and T-lymphocytes being 
attracted  to  the  ischemic  region  of  necrosis.20   Obviously, 
the increase in IL-6 concentrations demonstrates not only 
higher  cytokine  production  in  the  cells  involved  in  MI

pathogenesis but also reflects the activity of inflammation 
in the affected myocardium. The results of the correlation 
analysis, which showed positive correlations between IL-6 
and cardiospecific markers of myocardial necrosis, support 
this hypothesis.

IL-6 has recently been established to be capable of stimu-
lating PAI-1 in vitro generation in different cells; PAI-1 is not 
only the key component of the fibrinolytic system but also an 
IR marker.11 PAI-1 has recently been found to block insulin 
signaling in adipocytes, and at the same time the exposition 
of  high  insulin-content  adipocytes  was  accompanied  by 
increased PAI-1 concentrations in these cells. In this study, 
we found higher PAI-1 concentrations in both patient groups, 
and T2DM presence determined higher concentrations of this 
marker in the acute MI phase.

Meanwhile,  in  the  early  recovery  phase,  both  patient 
groups had lower PAI-1 concentrations, which demonstrated 
fibrinolytic activity normalization due to the treatment. The 
correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between 
IL-6 and PAI-1 concentrations in MI patients, which con-
firmed the IL-6-inducing impact on the production of this

protein.  Obviously,  in  MI,  excess  PAI-1  not  only  leads  to 
slower  fibrinolysis,  buildup  of  fibrin,  and  its  degradation 
products and thereby to microvascular thromboses but is also 
involved in IR development, which amplifies prothrombotic 
status.3

Along with activated cytokine production, cardiomyocyte 
ischemia and necrosis are accompanied by the production 
of acute-phase proteins, primarily CRP, which is involved 
in the responses aimed at localizing the affected region and 
myocardial remodeling initiation.16 CRP levels are known 
to increase significantly already 6–8 hours after myocardial 
tissue injury, reach their peak within 24–48 hours, and then 
decrease with a circulation half-time of 6 hours.17 This study 
shows higher CRP concentrations in both patient groups in 
the acute and early recovery phases. The presence of T2DM 
determined the highest protein concentrations in MI patients 
during the entire follow-up period, which might be associ-
ated with higher IL-6 concentrations in this patient category. 
Previous research has established IL-6 to be the most signifi-
cant inducer of CRP production. At the same time, experi-
mental studies showed that CRP was capable of inducing 
IR. According to Pravenec et al, transgenic rats expressing 
human CRP in high concentrations had metabolic disorders 
(hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and glycogen-production 
impairment stimulated by insulin in the skeletal muscles), 
which are intrinsic to IR syndrome.21 D’Alessandris et al 
established that CRP induces serine phosphorylation in the 
insulin-receptor  domain,  which  impairs  the  ability  of  the 
latter to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and leads to 
IR development in rat myocytes.22 Meanwhile, we discovered 
positive correlations between CRP levels and the activity 
of CK MB fraction. The observed correlative associations 
between CRP and metabolic IR markers demonstrate that 
IL-6  is  not  only  the  key  inflammation  mediator  but  also 
plays an active role in FFA and glucose metabolism, and 
fibrinolytic system protein production and secretion, which 
can be involved in pathogenetic events associated with IR 
in MI.

Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that MI as well as acti-
vated inflammation is accompanied by IR development. The 
most informative indicators of impaired sensitivity to insulin 
in MI are increases in FFA and PAI-1 levels compared to 
postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The observed strong 
associations  between  IL-6,  CRP,  basal  and  postprandial 
glycemia, and insulinemia, as well as FFA and PAI-1 levels 
evidence the involvement of nonspecific inflammation factors

in IR development and the amplification of prothrombogenic 
potential in MI patients.

In turn, the presence of preexisting IR determines higher 
thrombogenic status and increases the risk of not only pri-
mary but also recurrent cardiovascular events. The observed 
consistent patterns can lead to new treatment strategies to 
prevent T2DM in MI patients and improve quality of life.

Insulin resistance and inflammation markers in MI

Insulin resistance and inflammation markers in myocardial infarction

Olga Gruzdeva, Evgenya Uchasova, Yulia Dyleva, Ekaterina Belik, Ekaterina Shurygina and Olga Barbarash

This study showed that myocardial infarction is accompanied both by activated inflammatory response and insulin resistance. Strong correlations between interleukin-6 and free fatty acid concentrations demonstrate that nonspecific inflammation factors are involved in insulin resistance development in myocardial infarction patients. Consequently, these inflammatory cytokines might cause the development of insulin resistance.

Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that MI as well as activated inflammation is accompanied by IR development. The most informative indicators of impaired sensitivity to insulin in MI are increases in FFA and PAI-1 levels compared to postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The observed strong associations between IL-6, CRP, basal and postprandial glycemia, and insulinemia, as well as FFA and PAI-1 levels evidence the involvement of nonspecific inflammation factors in IR development and the amplification of prothrombogenic potential in MI patients.  

In turn, the presence of preexisting IR determines higher thrombogenic status and increases the risk of not only primary but also recurrent cardiovascular events. The observed consistent patterns can lead to new treatment strategies to prevent T2DM in MI patients and improve quality of life.

ABSTRACT

Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that can be triggered 
by a variety of factors, including pathogens, damaged cells and toxic compounds. 
These  factors  may  induce  acute  and/or  chronic  inflammatory  responses  in  the 
heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, intestinal tract and reproductive system, 
potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. Both infectious and non-infectious 
agents and cell damage activate inflammatory cells and trigger inflammatory signaling 
pathways, most commonly the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. Here, we review 
inflammatory responses within organs, focusing on the etiology of inflammation, 
inflammatory response mechanisms, resolution of inflammation, and organ-specific 
inflammatory responses.

INTRODUCTION

Inflammation is the immune system’s response to 
harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic 
compounds,  or  irradiation  [1],  and  acts  by  removing 
injurious  stimuli  and  initiating  the  healing  process  [2]. 
Inflammation  is  therefore  a  defense  mechanism  that  is 
vital  to  health  [3].  Usually,  during  acute  inflammatory 
responses, cellular and molecular events and interactions 
efficiently minimize impending injury or infection. This 
mitigation  process  contributes  to  restoration  of  tissue 
homeostasis  and  resolution  of  the  acute  inflammation. 
However, uncontrolled acute inflammation may become 
chronic, contributing to a variety of chronic inflammatory 
diseases [4].

At  the  tissue  level,  inflammation  is  characterized 
by  redness,  swelling,  heat,  pain,  and  loss  of  tissue 
function, which result from local immune, vascular and 
inflammatory  cell  responses  to  infection  or  injury  [5]. 
Important microcirculatory events that occur during the 
inflammatory  process  include  vascular  permeability 
changes,  leukocyte  recruitment  and  accumulation,  and 
inflammatory mediator release [2, 6].

Various pathogenic factors, such as infection, tissue 
injury, or cardiac infarction, can induce inflammation by 
causing  tissue  damage.  The  etiologies  of  inflammation 
can be infectious or non-infectious (Table 1). In response 
to  tissue  injury,  the  body  initiates  a  chemical  signaling 
cascade that stimulates responses aimed at healing affected 
tissues. These signals activate leukocyte chemotaxis from 
the general circulation to sites of damage. These activated 
leukocytes produce cytokines that induce inflammatory 
responses [7].

and  inflammatory  cells  recruited  from  the  blood  [8]. 
Inflammation is a common pathogenesis of many chronic 
diseases,  including  cardiovascular  and  bowel  diseases, 
diabetes, arthritis, and cancer [9]. Although inflammatory 
response  processes  depend  on  the  precise  nature  of 
the initial stimulus and its location in the body, they all

share a common mechanism, which can be summarized 
as  follows:  1)  cell  surface  pattern  receptors  recognize 
detrimental  stimuli;  2)  inflammatory  pathways  are 
activated; 3) inflammatory markers are released; and 4) 
inflammatory cells are recruited.

Pattern recognition receptor activation

Microbial structures known as pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) can trigger the inflammatory 
response 
through  activation  of  germline-encoded 
pattern-recognition  receptors  (PRRs)  expressed  in  both 
immune  and  nonimmune  cells  [10,  11].  Some  PRRs 
also  recognize  various  endogenous  signals  activated 
during tissue or cell damage and are known as danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) [11]. DAMPs are 
host biomolecules that can initiate and perpetuate a non-
infectious inflammatory response [12]. Disrupted cells can 
also recruit innate inflammatory cells in the absence of 
pathogens by releasing DAMPs [13]. 

Classes  of  PRR  families  include  the  Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic 
acid-inducible  gene  (RIG)-I-like  receptors  (RLRs),  and 
NOD-like  receptors  (NLRs)  [5].  TLRs  are  a  family  of 
highly  conserved,  mammalian  PRRs  that  participate  in 
the activation of the inflammatory response [14]. More 
than ten members of the TLR family have been identified, 
and TLRs are the most well-studied of the known PRRs 
[15]. Transmission of PAMPs and DAMPs is mediated 
by myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) along with 
TLRs. Signaling through TLRs activates an intracellular 
signaling  cascade  [16,  17]  that  leads  to  nuclear 
translocation  of  transcription  factors,  such  as  activator 
protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB or interferon regulatory factor 
3 (IRF3) (Figure 1). DAMPs and PAMPs share receptors, 
such as TLR4, suggesting similarities between infectious 
and noninfectious inflammatory responses [18, 19].

Activation of inflammatory pathways

Inflammatory  pathways  impact  the  pathogenesis 
of  a  number  of  chronic  diseases,  and  involve  common 
inflammatory  mediators  and  regulatory  pathways. 
Inflammatory  stimuli  activate  intracellular  signaling 
pathways that then activate production of inflammatory 

mediators.  Primary  inflammatory  stimuli,  including 
microbial products and cytokines such as interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), mediate inflammation through interaction with 
the TLRs, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), 
and the TNF receptor (TNFR) [20]. Receptor activation 
triggers  important  intracellular  signaling  pathways, 
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and Janus kinase (JAK)-
signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT) 
pathways [21–23].

NF-κB pathway

The  NF-κB  transcription  factor  plays  important 
roles  in  inflammatory,  immune  response,  survival,  and 
apoptosis  processes  [24].  The  NF-κB  family  includes 
five related transcription factors: P50, p52, RelA (p65), 
RelB, and c-Rel [25, 26]. NF-κB activity is induced by a 
range of stimuli, including pathogen-derived substances, 
intercellular inflammatory cytokines, and many enzymes 
[27,  28].  Under  physiological  conditions,  IκB  proteins 
present in the cytoplasm inhibit NF-κB [29]. PRRs use 
similar  signal  transduction  mechanisms  to  activate  IκB 
kinase (IKK), which is composed of two kinase subunits, 
IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, such as IKKγ. 
IKK  regulates  NF-κB  pathway  activation  through  IκB 
phosphorylation  [8].  IκB  phosphorylation  results  in  its 
degradation by the proteasome and the subsequent release 
of NF-κB for nuclear translocation and gene transcription 
activation [30]. This pathway regulates pro-inflammatory 
cytokine production and inflammatory cell recruitment, 
which contribute to the inflammatory response (Figure 2).

MAPK pathway

MAPKs  are  a  family  of  serine/threonine  protein 
kinases  that  direct  cellular  responses  to  a  variety  of 
stimuli,  including  osmotic  stress,  mitogens,  heat  shock, 
and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-
6),  which  regulate  cell  proliferation,  differentiation,  cell 
survival and apoptosis [31, 32]. The mammalian MAPKs 
include  extracellular-signal-regulated  kinase  ERK1/2, 
p38  MAP  Kinase,  and  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinases  (JNK) 
[33].  Each  MAPK  signaling  pathway  comprises  at  least 

7205

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetthree components: a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), 
and  a  MAPK  kinase  kinase  (MAPKKK).  MAPKKKs 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs  [33,  34].  ERKs  are 
generally activated by mitogens and differentiation signals, 

while  inflammatory  stimuli  and  stress  activate  JNK  and 
p38 [35]. MKK1 and MKK2 activate ERK1/2, MKK4 and 
MKK7 activate JNK, and MKK3 and MKK6 activate p38. 
Activation of the MAPKs, including Erk1/2, JNK, leads to 
phosphorylation and activation of p38 transcription factorsv  

Figure 1: TLR signaling. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways are shown. Signaling through TLRs activates intracellular 
signaling cascades that lead to nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB or IRF3, which regulates the inflammatory response.

Figure 2: NF-κB pathway. This pathway is triggered by TLRs and inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, leading to activation 
of  RelA/p50  complexes  that  regulate  expression  of  inflammatory  cytokines.  NF-κB  signaling  requires  IKK  subunits.  which  regulate 
pathway activation through IκB phosphorylation.

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetpresent  in  the  cytoplasm  or  nucleus,  which  initiates  the 
inflammatory response [32, 36] (Figure 3).

JAK-STAT pathway

The  highly  conserved  JAK-STAT  pathway  involves 
diverse  cytokines,  growth  factors,  interferons,  and  related 
molecules,  such  as  leptin  and  growth  hormone,  and  is  a 
signaling mechanism through which extracellular factors can 
control  gene  expression  [37].  Receptor-associated  JAKs  are 
activated  by  ligands  and  phosphorylate  one  other,  creating 
docking  sites  for  STATs,  which  are  latent,  cytoplasmic 
transcription factors. Cytoplasmic STATs recruited to these sites 
undergo phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization before 
translocation  to  the  nucleus  [38].  Tyrosine  phosphorylation 
is  essential  for  STAT  dimerization  and  DNA  binding  [39]. 
Therefore, JAK/STAT signaling allows for the direct translation 
of an extracellular signal into a transcriptional response. For 
example, binding of IL-6 family members to plasma membrane 
receptors  activates  the  JAK-STAT  proteins.  STAT  proteins 
translocated into the nucleus bind target gene promoter regions 
to regulate transcription of inflammatory genes (Figure 4) [40].

Dysregulation  of  NF-κB,  MAPK,  or  JAK-STAT 
activity  is  associated  with  inflammatory,  autoimmune, 
and metabolic diseases, and cancer [41]. Signaling through 
transcription factors results in secretion of cytokines [42, 
43].  Multiple  transcription  factors  regulate  a  variety  of 
inflammatory  genes,  such  as  IL-1,  TNF-α,  IL-6  [44], 
colony stimulating factor (CSF), interferons, transforming 
growth factor (TGF), and chemokines.

Inflammatory markers

Markers are used in clinical applications to indicate 
normal versus pathogenic biological processes, and assess 
responses  to  therapeutic  interventions.  Inflammatory 
markers  may  be  predictive  of  inflammatory  diseases 
[45–50], and correlate with the causes and consequences 
of various inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular 
diseases, endothelial dysfunctions, and infection [51, 52]. 
Stimuli activate inflammatory cells, such as macrophages 
and adipocytes, and induce production of inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and inflammatory 
proteins  and  enzymes. These  molecules  can  potentially 
serve as biomarkers for diseases diagnosis, prognosis, and 
therapeutic decision making [53–57].

Inflammatory cytokines

and lymphocytes. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines

facilitate  and 
Inflammatory  cytokines  are  classified  as  ILs,  colony 
stimulating  factors  (CSF),  IFNs,  TNFs,  TGFs,  and 
chemokines,  and  are  produced  by  cells  primarily  to 

inflammation, 

inhibit 

recruit leukocytes to the site of infection or injury [58]. 
Cytokines  modulate  the  immune  response  to  infection 
or  inflammation  and  regulate  inflammation  itself  via  a 
complex  network  of  interactions.  However,  excessive 
inflammatory  cytokine  production  can  lead  to  tissue 
damage,  hemodynamic  changes,  organ  failure,  and 
ultimately death [59, 60]. A better understanding of how to 
regulate cytokine pathways would allow for more accurate 
identification  of  agent-mediated  inflammation  and  the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases [58].

Inflammatory proteins and enzymes

Inflammatory  proteins  in  the  blood,  including 
C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  haptoglobin,  serum  amyloid 
A,  fibrinogen,  and  alpha  1-acid  glycoprotein  [61], 
help  restore  homeostasis  and  reduce  microbial  growth 
independently  of  antibodies  during  trauma,  stress,  or 
infection [62]. Abnormal activation of certain enzymes, 
including  high-mobility  group  box  1  (HMGB1), 
superoxide  dismutase  (SOD),  glutathione  peroxidase 
(GPx),  NADPH  oxidase  (NOX),  inducible  nitric  oxide 
synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, play key 
roles in the development of inflammation-related diseases, 
such as cardiovascular disease and cancer [63–66]. For 
example, extracellular HMGB1 effects may be mediated 
by  activation  of TLR-coupled  signaling  pathways  [67]. 
The primary target of extracellular HMGB1 is TLR4 [68], 
which triggers MyD88-dependent intracellular signaling 
cascades involved in activation of the NF-κB and MAPK 
pathways.  This  leads  to  release  of  such  inflammatory 
cytokines as TNF-α and IL-1β [67]. Inflammatory proteins 
and enzymes have been used as inflammation, infection, 
and trauma biomarkers in medicine.

Other inflammatory markers

(MDA), 

Antioxidant defense systems, including antioxidant 
enzymes, influence oxidative stress. Elevated oxidative 
stress can induce production of reactive oxygen species 
8-Hydroxy-2-
(ROS),  malondialdehyde 
deoxyguanosine  (8-OHdG)  and  isoprostanes  [64,  69], 
each of which can activate various transcription factors, 
including NF-κB, AP-1, p53, and STAT. Thus, this cascade 
can increase expression of genes encoding growth factors, 
inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [70]. Oxidative 
stress  is  associated  with  the  pathogenesis  of  multiple 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, 
hypertension,  aging,  and  atherosclerosis.  Therefore, 
oxidative stress products can also be used as markers of 
the inflammatory response.

macrophages, monocytes, and other cells mediate local 
responses  to  tissue  damage  and  infection.  At  sites  of 
tissue  injury,  damaged  epithelial  and  endothelial  cells 
release  factors  that  trigger  the  inflammatory  cascade, 
along with chemokines and growth factors, which attract 
neutrophils and monocytes. The first cells attracted to a 
site  of  injury  are  neutrophils,  followed  by  monocytes, 
lymphocytes (natural killer cells [NK cells], T cells, and B 
cells), and mast cells [71–73]. Monocytes can differentiate 
into macrophages and dendritic cells and are recruited via 

7208

chemotaxis into damaged tissues. Inflammation-mediated 
immune  cell  alterations  are  associated  with  many 
diseases, including asthma, cancer, chronic inflammatory 
diseases, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and autoimmune and 
degenerative diseases.

Neutrophils,  which 

target  microorganisms 

in 
the  body,  can  also  damage  host  cells  and  tissues  [74]. 
Neutrophils  are  key  mediators  of  the  inflammatory 
response, and program antigen presenting cells to activate T 
cells and release localized factors to attract monocytes and 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetdendritic cells [7]. Macrophages are important components 
of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and are critical in 
inflammation initiation, maintenance, and resolution [75]. 
During  inflammation,  macrophages  present  antigens, 
undergo phagocytosis, and modulate the immune response 
by  producing  cytokines  and  growth  factors.  Mast  cells, 
which reside in connective tissue matrices and on epithelial 
surfaces,  are  effector  cells  that  initiate  inflammatory 
responses.  Activated  mast  cell  release  a  variety  of 
inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, 
histamine,  proteases,  prostaglandins,  leukotrienes,  and 
serglycin proteoglycans [76].

Multiple  groups  have  demonstrated  that  platelets 
impact  inflammatory  processes,  from  atherosclerosis 
to  infection.  Platelet  interactions  with  inflammatory 
cells  may  mediate  pro-inflammatory  outcomes.  The 
acute  phase  response  (APR)  is  the  earliest  response  to 
infection or injury, and some studies have indicated that 
platelets induce the APR [77]. After being recruited by 
inflammatory stimuli, immune cells amplify and sustain 
the APR by releasing local inflammatory mediators at the 
site of recruitment.

RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION

To  prevent  progression  from  acute  inflammation  to 
persistent,  chronic  inflammation,  the  inflammatory  response 
must  be  suppressed  to  prevent  additional  tissue  damage. 
Inflammation resolution is a well-managed process involving 
the spatially- and temporally-controlled production of mediators, 
during  which  chemokine  gradients  are  diluted  over  time. 

Circulating white blood cells eventually no longer sense these 
gradients and are not recruited to sites of injury. Dysregulation of 
this process can lead to uncontrolled chronic inflammation [78]. 
Inflammation resolution processes that rectify tissue homeostasis 
include reduction or cessation of tissue infiltration by neutrophils 
and  apoptosis  of  spent  neutrophils,  counter-regulation  of 
chemokines and cytokines, macrophage transformation from 
classically  to  alternatively  activated  cells,  and  initiation  of 
healing [79, 80].
Chronic 

inflammation  occurs  when 
to  eliminate 

acute 
inflammatory  mechanisms  fail 
tissue 
injury [81], and may lead to a host of diseases, such as 
cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers [82]. Understanding the 
common mechanisms that orchestrate dysfunction in the 
various  organ  systems  will  allow  for  development  and 
production of improved targeted therapies.

ORGAN-SPECIFIC 
RESPONSES

INFLAMMATORY 

Inflammation  has  long  been  recognized  as  a 
major  cause  of  disease.  It  is  estimated  that  some  15% 
of human cancers are associated with chronic infection 
and inflammation [83]. Acute and chronic inflammation-
mediated tissue injury is observed in many organ systems, 
including the heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, 
intestinal tract, and reproductive system.

MAPKKKs  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs.  The  mammalian  MAPK  family 
includes Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. In the Erk1/2 pathway, Erk1/2 is activated by MKK1/2, which is activated by Raf. In the JNK pathway, 
JNK is activated by MKK4/7, which is activated by MEKK1/4, ASK1, and MLK3. In the p38 pathway, p38 is activated by MKK3/6, 
which is activated by MLK3, TAK, and DLK. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate various proteins, including transcription factors, resulting 
in regulation of inflammatory responses.

Cardiovascular disease, and its underlying pathology, 
atherosclerosis, is the major cause of death and disability 
worldwide [84, 85]. By 2030, almost 23.6 million people 
are projected to die annually from cardiovascular disorders 
[86,  87].  Inflammatory  mediators  play  key  roles  in 
atherosclerosis, from initial leukocyte recruitment through 
rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque [88–91]. Inflammation 
is also an early event in cardiac stress. Elevated levels of 
endothelial adhesion molecules and increased inflammatory 
cytokine  and  chemokine  production  and  release  are 
observed in affected cardiac tissues [92].

The innate immune system is the primary cardiac 
defense  against  pathogens  and  tissue  damage  [93]. 
Myocardial  infarction,  which  commonly  results  from 
coronary atherosclerosis and involves acute loss of many 
myocardial cells, is the most common cause of cardiac 
injury [94]. Necrotic cardiac cells initiate an inflammatory 
cascade  to  clear  dead  cells  and  debris  from  the  infarct 
[95,  96].  Cell  death  releases  intracellular  components 
that  activate  innate  immune  mechanisms  to  initiate  an 
inflammatory  response.  Endogenous  ligands  released 
following  injury  are  recognized  as  danger  signals  by 
cell  surface  receptors,  and  activate  inflammation  [97, 
98].  TLR-mediated  pathways  trigger  post-infarction 
inflammatory  responses  by  activating  NF-κB  signaling 
[98–103]. Chemokines recruit inflammatory leukocytes to 
the infarct, and cytokines promote leukocyte-endothelial 
cell  adhesions  [104,  105].  Moreover, TGF-β  and  IL-10 
promote  cardiac  repair  by  suppressing  inflammation, 
enhancing  myofibroblast  phenotypic  modulation,  and 
promoting extracellular matrix deposition [106, 107].

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death 
and disability in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially 
those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), in whom cardiovascular 
disease occurs 14.6 years earlier on average [108]. About 
two-thirds  of  deaths  in  people  with  diabetes  are  due  to 

cardiovascular disease; among these, approximately 40% 
die from ischemic heart disease, 15% from other forms 
of heart disease, principally congestive heart failure, and 
about  10%  from  stroke  [109].  Recent  global  estimates 
indicate that over 422 million adults currently live with 
diabetes, of which over 90% have T2D.

Diabetes 

is  a  group  of  metabolic  disorders 
characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels, and is 
a major global health challenge, both to individuals and 
their families, and to healthcare systems [110]. Diabetes 
complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, 
limb amputation, blindness, and nerve damage. Diabetes 
results  from  either  impaired  insulin  production  in  the 
pancreas or body cells not responding to produced insulin 
[111]. Insulin resistance is defined as decreased insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake, and is associated with inactivity, 
obesity, and aging. Pancreatic islet cells respond to insulin 
resistance by enhancing insulin secretion and cell mass. 
However, when islet β-cells are unable to compensate for 
insulin resistance, insulin deficiency develops, followed by 
T2D [112], which is increasingly being characterized as 
an inflammatory disease [113, 114]. Elevated circulating 
levels of acute-phase proteins, including CRP, fibrinogen, 
serum  amyloid  A,  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor, 
and  haptoglobin,  along  with  sialic  acid,  cytokines,  and 
chemokines,  have  been  observed  in  patients  with  T2D. 
Elevated  IL-1β,  IL-6,  TNF-α,  and  CRP  levels  are  also 
predictive of T2D. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is 
elevated  in  obesity  and  prediabetes  prior  to T2D  onset. 
Excessive nutrient levels, including those of glucose and 
free  fatty  acids,  promote  insulin  resistance.  T2D  also 
activates the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways, 
which can each promote tissue inflammation [110, 114, 
115]. Metabolic stressors also negatively impact pancreatic 
islet cells and insulin-sensitive tissues, including adipose 
tissue, promoting local cytokine and chemokine production 
and release. At the same time, immune cells, such as mast 
cells  and  macrophages,  are  recruited  and  contribute  to 

Figure 4: JAK-STAT pathway. Following IL-6 binding, signal is transduced by a receptor to activate the JAKs, which then activate 
STATs. STATs are dephosphorylated in the nucleus, leading to activation of downstream cytokines

release from adipose tissues into the circulation promotes 
further inflammation in other tissues [116].    

Pancreas

by 

caused 

pancreatic 

Pancreatitis, 

duct 
obstruction,  trypsinogen  gene  mutation,  or  alcoholism, 
is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas [117]. Acute 
pancreatitis (AP) incidence ranges from 4–45 per 100,000 
patients per year and increases annually by approximately 
1.3–4.0% in most developed countries. AP is one of the 
most common gastrointestinal causes for hospitalization in 
the US, and chronic pancreatitis (CP) is less common than 
AP. However, CP patients experience chronic abdominal 
insufficiency, 
pain  and  exocrine  and/or  endocrine 
leading  to  reduced  quality  of  life  [118].  Pancreatitis  is 
characterized by acinar cell destruction and activation of 
inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, 
and granulocytes, which secrete inflammatory cytokines 
[117,  119].  These  cytokines  further  activate  pancreatic 
stellate  cells  (PSCs)  to  promote  CP  [120].  Pancreatitis 
development requires various molecular pathways, such as 
NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT, which play critical roles 
in inflammatory cell activation during pancreatitis [117]. 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal 
of malignancies and a major health burden [121], and is the 
fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the US 
[118]. There is a strong link between antecedent CP and PC 
[122]. CP leads to fibrosis, which is a common pathological 
feature and major risk factor for PC [123]. Pancreatic cancer 
results from dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes, as well as growth factors and their receptors, including 
epidermal growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and many cytokines, 
such as TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, which modulate 
pathways involved in growth and differentiation [124, 125]. 
Shi,  et  al.  has  showed  that  VEGF  is  upregulated  by  low 
extracellular PH (acidosis), which occurs frequently around 
necrotic regions in tumors, and that acidosis activates IL-8 
[126]. VEGF and IL-8 are important angiogenic factors in 
PC [126], and acidosis-promoted upregulation of these genes 
can be mediated through NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation and 
cooperation [127]. 

Liver

Inflammation  in  the  liver  protects  this  organ  from 
infection and injury, but excessive inflammation may lead 
to  extensive  loss  of  hepatocytes,  ischemia-reperfusion 
injury,  metabolic  alterations,  and  eventually  permanent 
hepatic  damage  [128].  Inflammation  can  destroy  hepatic 
parenchymal  cells,  increasing  the  risk  of  chronic  liver 
diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver diseases are a leading cause 
of morbidity and mortality in the US [129].

7211

The  liver  is  the  largest  solid  organ  in  the  body 
[130], and is a target of both infectious and non-infectious 
inflammatory  pathologies.  Infectious  inflammation  of 
the  liver  is  mainly  caused  by  microorganisms,  such  as 
bacterial  products,  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV),  or  hepatitis 
C  virus  (HCV)  [131,  132].  Sterile  inflammation  (SI)  is 
also  important  in  the  pathology  of  many  liver  diseases, 
such  as  alcoholic  or  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis,  drug-
induced liver injury, and ischemia/reperfusion [133–135]. 
In SI, endogenous DAMPs are released to injured tissues 
and  activate  immune  cells  [136]. While  pathogen-driven 
inflammation and SI differ, they share several functional 
characteristics.  Many  receptors  and  pathways  can  be 
activated by both PAMPs and DAMPs [137]. TLR4, for 
example,  can  be  activated  by  bacterial  LPS  and  cellular 
HMGB1.  Because  of  the  liver’s  unique  vascular  supply, 
PAMPs of intestinal origin and DAMPs from hepatocytes 
both contribute to inflammation in a variety of diseases. For 
example, PRR activation by DAMPs and PAMPs can induce 
production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  immune 
cell localization to sites of injury. Recognition of DAMPs 
and  PAMPs  results  in  assembly  of  the  inflammasome,  a 
cytosolic protein complex that activates the serine protease 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β and 
other cytokines. At the same time, Kupffer cell activation 
and  inflammatory  cell  recruitment  leads  to  production 
of  cytokines  and  chemokines  that  promote  long-term 
inflammation, hepatocyte damage, and/or cholestasis [138].

Lung

Lung  inflammatory  diseases  involve  complex 
interactions  among  and  between  structural  and  immune 
cells  [139].  Lung  inflammation  results  predominantly 
from tissue exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens, and/
or environmental pollutants. Excessive acute inflammation 
and subsequent lung injury can cause pulmonary fibrosis 
and  impair  gas  exchange.  Unresolved  lung  injury  and 
chronic  inflammation  are  frequently  observed  in  acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome,  cystic  fibrosis,  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma [140–
142]. Approximately 90% of COPD cases are associated 
with  cigarette  smoking-induced  inflammation  in  small 
airways and lung parenchyma [143]. Cigarette smoking is a 
major risk factor for COPD, which involves both systemic 
and  pulmonary  inflammation.  Long-term  smoking  can 
cause macrophage, neutrophil, and activated T lymphocyte 
infiltration  into  airways,  and  promote  production  of 
chemokines,  oxygen  radicals,  proteases,  and  cytokines, 
including that of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, in the lung [144].

Kidney

Kidney inflammation contributes to progressive renal 
injury,  which  may  lead  to  glomerulonephritis,  end-stage 
renal  disease,  or  acute  or  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD) 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget[145–147]. Approximately 10–12% of the population suffers 
from CKD, and some 50% of elderly patients show signs of 
kidney dysfunction, which is associated with high morbidity 
and mortality [52]. Kidney inflammation is most commonly 
induced by infection, ischemia/reperfusion, in situ immune-
complex  formation/deposition,  or  complement  pathway 
dysregulation [145]. CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI) 
are the most severe types of kidney disease [148]. Interstitial 
inflammation  and  tubular  injury  are  commonly  observed 
in  acute  and  chronic  kidney  injury  cases.  Renal  tubular 
epithelial  cells  are  likely  important  promoters  of  kidney 
inflammation, secreting a variety of inflammatory cytokines 
in response to both immune and non-immune factors, and 
leukocyte  infiltration  depends  on  the  local  presence  of 
these cytokines [146]. Stimuli that can induce kidney injury 
activate  transcription  factors  (NF-κB  or  MAPK).  These 
stimuli  include  cytokines,  growth  factors,  DAMPs,  and 
PAMPs, TLRs, Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and metabolic 
(high glucose, advanced glycosylation end products) and 
immune mediators [147].

Intestinal tract

Acute  and  chronic  inflammatory  diseases  of  the 
intestine  can  cause  various  health  issues,  and  decrease 
patient quality of life worldwide [149, 150]. The complex, 
polygenetic  inflammatory  bowel  diseases  (IBDs)  are 
characterized by an excessive inflammatory response to 
gut  lumen  microbial  flora  [151].  IBDs  mainly  include 
ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  and  Crohn  disease  (CD),  but 
also  noninfectious  inflammation  of  the  bowel  [152, 
153]. Idiopathic IBDs, such as CD and UC, are caused 
by  cytokine-driven,  non-infectious  inflammation  of 
the  gut.  For  example,  CD  is  associated  with  excessive 
IFN-γ/IL-17  and  IL-12/IL-23  production,  while  UC  is 
associated with excess IL-13 [153]. Thus, IBD appears to 
be the result of a dysfunctional interaction between gut 
bacteria  and  the  mucosal  immune  system  [154]. A  key 
process in the immune system’s response to microbes is 
the recognition of microbial agents via PRRs, including 
TLRs  and  nucleotide-binding  oligomerization  domain 
containing NLRs, which sense evolutionarily conserved 
PAMPs  [155].  Upon  PAMP  detection,  PRRs  activate 
intracellular signaling pathways that induce production of 
cytokines and chemokines to promote host resistance to 
infection. TLR (mainly TLR4) signaling induces NF-κB 
and MAPK transcription. At the same time, NLRs are also 
activated through ligand detection [154], in turn activating 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β, 
interleukin-18 and other cytokines [154].

Reproductive system

ovulation,  and  parturition  trigger  the  inflammatory 
cascade.  However, 
initiation  and  maintenance  of 
inflammatory  processes  are  also  important  components 
of  many  reproductive  tract  diseases.  Damaged  tissues 
locally release inflammatory interleukins, growth factors, 
cytokines,  and  prostaglandins,  which  activate  signaling 
pathways  and  recruit  immune  cells  (e.g.  neutrophils 
and  macrophages)  to  the  site  of  injury.  This  process 
synergistically controls tissue remodeling and repair, but 
can also induce inflammatory diseases [7]. Inflammatory 
cytokines, including IL-6, are the primary mediators of 
inflammation-related  reproductive  tract  diseases,  and 
act via signal transduction pathways such as the MAPK 
pathway [157, 158].

Brain

Inflammatory  responses  occur  in  the  brain  in 
many  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  diseases,  including 
autoimmune  diseases,  neurodegenerative  diseases  like 
Alzheimer’s  (AD)  and  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD),  and 
epilepsy. Inflammatory responses in the brain can enhance 
neuronal  excitability,  injure  cells,  and  increase  blood-
brain  barrier  permeability  to  various  molecules  [159–
161].  Inflammation-associated  CNS  diseases  result  from 
activation of the brain’s resident immune cells and microglia, 
which  produce  pro-inflammatory  markers  [162].  These 
inflammation  processes  also  involve  both  the  innate  and 
adaptive immune systems and resemble immune responses 
to  systemic  infection.  Cytokines  and  TLRs  are  major 
inflammatory  mediators  in  the  transition  between  innate 
and adaptive. Inflammatory responses in the CNS may also 
be triggered by endogenous ligands recognized by TLRs. 
DAMPs,  such  as  heat-shock  proteins  and  extracellular 
matrix degradation molecules, entering the brain through 
a damaged blood-brain barrier may initiate inflammatory 
responses.  The  CNS  inflammatory  response  is  strong  in 
reaction to both infectious agents and brain injury, such as 
tissue damage observed following ischemic, traumatic, or 
excitotoxic brain injury, or seizure [160, 163, 164].

CONCLUSIONS

Inflammation  is  frequently  a  key  element  in  the 
pathological  progression  of  organ  disease.  Three  main 
pathways,  NF-κB,  MAPK,  and  JAK-STAT,  play  major 
roles in inflammation, and dysregulation of one or more 
of these pathways may lead to inflammation-associated 
disease. A better understanding of inflammatory response 
pathways  and  molecular  mechanisms  will  undoubtedly 
contribute  to  improved  prevention  and  treatment  of 
inflammatory diseases.

The  hallmarks  of  inflammation  are  observed 
during  many  normal  reproductive  processes,  including 
menstruation,  ovulation,  implantation,  and  parturition 
[156].  Injury  and  healing  caused  by  menstruation,

ABSTRACT

Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that can be triggered 
by a variety of factors, including pathogens, damaged cells and toxic compounds. 
These  factors  may  induce  acute  and/or  chronic  inflammatory  responses  in  the 
heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, intestinal tract and reproductive system, 
potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. Both infectious and non-infectious 
agents and cell damage activate inflammatory cells and trigger inflammatory signaling 
pathways, most commonly the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. Here, we review 
inflammatory responses within organs, focusing on the etiology of inflammation, 
inflammatory response mechanisms, resolution of inflammation, and organ-specific 
inflammatory responses.


INTRODUCTION

Inflammation is the immune system’s response to 
harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic 
compounds,  or  irradiation  [1],  and  acts  by  removing 
injurious  stimuli  and  initiating  the  healing  process  [2]. 
Inflammation  is  therefore  a  defense  mechanism  that  is 
vital  to  health  [3].  Usually,  during  acute  inflammatory 
responses, cellular and molecular events and interactions 
efficiently minimize impending injury or infection. This 
mitigation  process  contributes  to  restoration  of  tissue 
homeostasis  and  resolution  of  the  acute  inflammation. 


Heart

Cardiovascular disease, and its underlying pathology, 
atherosclerosis, is the major cause of death and disability 
worldwide [84, 85]. By 2030, almost 23.6 million people 
are projected to die annually from cardiovascular disorders 
[86,  87].  Inflammatory  mediators  play  key  roles  in 
atherosclerosis, from initial leukocyte recruitment through 
rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque [88–91]. 


The inflammatory response is the coordinate 
activation  of 
regulate 
signaling  pathways 
inflammatory  mediator  levels  in  resident  tissue  cells 
and  inflammatory  cells  recruited  from  the  blood  [8]. 


Diabetes 

is  a  group  of  metabolic  disorders 
characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels, and is 
a major global health challenge, both to individuals and 
their families, and to healthcare systems [110].

Pancreatitis, caused by pancreatic duct obstruction,  trypsinogen  gene mutation, or alcoholism, is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas [117]. Acute pancreatitis (AP) incidence ranges from 4–45 per 100,000 patients per year and increases annually by approximately 1.3–4.0% in most developed countries. AP is one of the most common gastrointestinal causes for hospitalization in the US, and chronic pancreatitis (CP) is less common than AP. However, CP patients experience chronic abdominal pain and exocrine and/or endocrine insufficiency, leading to reduced quality of life [118]. Pancreatitis is characterized by acinar cell destruction and activation of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and granulocytes, which secrete inflammatory cytokines [117,  119].  

The liver is the largest solid organ in the body [130], and is a target of both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory pathologies. Infectious inflammation of the liver is mainly caused by microorganisms, such as bacterial products, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) [131, 132]. Chronic liver diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US [129].

Lung inflammatory diseases involve complex interactions among and between structural and immune cells [139].  Lung inflammation results predominantly from tissue exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens, and/or environmental pollutants. Excessive acute inflammation and subsequent lung injury can cause pulmonary fibrosis and impair gas exchange. Approximately 90% of COPD cases are associated with cigarette smoking-induced inflammation in small airways and lung parenchyma [143]. 

Kidney inflammation contributes to progressive renal injury,  which may lead to glomerulonephritis, end-stage renal disease, or acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) [145–147]. Approximately 10–12% of the population suffers from CKD, and some 50% of elderly patients show signs of kidney dysfunction, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality [52].

Acute and chronic inflammatory diseases of the  intestine can cause various health issues, and decrease patient quality of life worldwide [149, 150]. The complex, polygenetic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by an excessive inflammatory response to gut lumen microbial flora [151]. Idiopathic IBDs, such as CD and UC, are caused by cytokine-driven, non-infectious inflammation of the gut.  

The hallmarks of inflammation are observed during many normal reproductive processes, including menstruation, ovulation, implantation, and parturition [156].  Injury and healing caused by menstruation, ovulation, and parturition trigger the inflammatory cascade. However, initiation and maintenance of inflammatory processes are also important components of many reproductive tract diseases.

Inflammatory responses occur in the brain in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), and epilepsy. Inflammation-associated CNS diseases result from activation of the brain’s resident immune cells and microglia, which produce pro-inflammatory markers [162].

Purpose: Sepsis is an aggressive and life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by infection. Excessive inflammation and coagula-
tion  contribute  to  the  negative  outcomes  for  sepsis,  resulting  in  high  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  this  study,  we  explored  whether 
Eupatilin could alleviate lung injury, reduce inflammation and coagulation during sepsis.
Methods:  We  constructed  an  in  vitro  sepsis  model  by  stimulating  RAW264.7  cells  with  1  μg/mL  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  for  6 
hours. The cells were divided into control group, LPS group, LPS+ Eupatilin (Eup) group, and Eup group to detect their cell activity 
and inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factor levels. Cells in LPS+Eup and Eup group were pretreated with Eupatilin (10μM) for 
2 hours. In vivo, mice were divided into sham operation group, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group and Eup group. Mice in the 
CLP  and  Eup  groups  were  pretreated  with  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  for  2  hours  by  gavage.  Lung  tissue  and  plasma  were  collected  and 
inflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors and signaling were measured.
Results:  In  vitro,  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-α,  interleukin  (IL)-1β,  IL-6,  and  tissue  factor  (TF)  expression  in  LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7  cells  was  downregulated  by  Eupatilin  (10μM).  Furthermore,  Eupatilin  inhibited  phosphorylation  of  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway and suppressed p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. In vivo, Eupatilin increased the survival rate of the mice. In septic 
mice, plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as TF, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), D-dimer, thrombin- 
antithrombin complex (TAT) and fibrinogen were improved by Eupatilin. Moreover, Eupatilin alleviated lung injury by improving the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF, fibrin deposition and macrophage infiltration in lung tissue.
Conclusion: Our results revealed that Eupatilin may modulate inflammation and coagulation indicators as well as improve lung injury 
in sepsis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
Keywords: Eupatilin, sepsis, inflammation, coagulation, JAK2/STAT3

Introduction
Sepsis  is  a  life-threatening  organ  dysfunction  caused  by  infection,  which  results  from  dysregulated  host  response.1 
A study reported in Lancet showed that sepsis remains a major cause of health loss worldwide, with 48.9 million cases 
each year and approximately 11 million deaths, which accounts around one-fifth of the total global deaths.2 According to 
Nature Reviews Disease Primers, more than half of sepsis patients are complicated with coagulation system imbalance.3 
Moreover,  in  patients  who  have  sepsis  with  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC)  the  mortality  rate  is  almost

twice that of sepsis patients without DIC.4  Therefore, reducing inflammation and coagulation disorders could be the key 
to reducing sepsis mortality.

Macrophages  are  involved  in  various  pathophysiological  processes  in  sepsis,  including  inflammation,  coagulation, 
immunity  and  metabolism,  and  play  a  crucial  role  in  sepsis-induced  acute  lung  injury.5,6  In  the  early  stages  of  sepsis, 
macrophages  engulf  pathogens  and  activate  the  innate  immune  system.  Macrophages  express  pattern  recognition 
receptors  (PRRs),  which  can  detect  pathogen-associated  molecular  patterns  (PAMPs)  or  damage-associated  molecular 
patterns (DAMPs), initiating a series of immune cell activations and upregulating the expression of inflammation-related 
genes, that produce a series of inflammatory cytokines.7 In this process, the body targets pathogens to contain, kill and/or 
expel  them.  However,  there  is  also  a  defense  strategy,  called  disease  tolerance,  which  refers  to  limiting  the  negative 
impact of infection on the host without affecting the pathogen load.8  The expression of high levels of PRRs and other 
receptors, including cytokines by tissue-resident macrophages contributes to the establishment of disease tolerance.9  In 
addition,  signal  transduction  pathways  that  are  activated  in  response  to  PAMPs  or  DAMPs  also  contribute  to  tissue 
damage control and establishment of disease tolerance, both of which limit the negative effects of infection.

Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  an  important  cell  wall  constituent  of  Gram-negative  bacteria,  is  a  potent  inducer  of 
inflammatory  responses.10  After  exposure  to  LPS,  macrophages  produce  large  amounts  of  inflammatory  cytokines, 
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).11 Recent studies have shown that monocytes and macrophages, 
especially  those  from  myeloid  origin,  are  main  cell  types  that  express  tissue  factor  (TF),  which  causes  pathological 
coagulation in sepsis.12,13  In severe sepsis, macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators and the coagulation system is 
activated, which promotes fibrin production and thrombosis.14,15  In addition, coagulation abnormalities contribute to the 
lethality of sepsis and septic acute lung injury (ALI).16 Many in vivo studies use cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model 
in mice, which can simulate the pathological condition of abdominal infection through cecal contamination and, to some 
extent, mimic the response of clinical patients with sepsis.17,18  Thus, we conducted sepsis model using LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP-induced mice in our study.

Eupatilin (Eup) is a lipophilic flavonoid isolated from Artemisia argyi, which has the effect of warming the meridian 
to stop bleeding, dispersing cold and relieving pain. In recent years, Eupatilin has been found to have biological activities 
against  inflammation,  oxidation,  and  tumors.19  It  has  antioxidant  and  anti-apoptotic  effects  against  cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity,  as  well  as  inhibiting  inflammatory  responses  and  aging  in  nucleus  pulposus  (NP)  cells.20,21  In  addition, 
a derivative of Eupatilin to treat dry eye disease is being developed and is undergoing Phase I study.22 Eupatilin can also 
reduce  the  inflammatory  response  in  LPS-induced  rats,  decreasing  the  level  of  surfactant  protein  (SP)-A,  SP-D,  and 
inflammatory  factors.23  Moreover,  Eupatilin  can  reduce  the  number  of  inflammatory  cells  in  OVA-induced  asthmatic 
mice  and  inhibit  the  NF-κB  and  MAPK  pathways  in  both  mice  and  RAW264.7  cells.24  Besides,  by inhibiting  STAT3, 
Eupatilin  attenuates  airway  remodeling  and  inhibits  gastric  cancer  cell  growth.25,26  A  recent  study  has  shown  that 
Eupatilin  is  associated  with  coagulation.  It  can  inhibit  arachidonic  acid  (AA)-induced  platelet  aggregation  and  throm-
boxane  A2  (TXA2)  and  5-hydroxytryptophan  (5-HT)  generation.27  Nevertheless,  the  underlying  mechanisms  and 
whether  it  can  be  used  to  protect  sepsis-induced  coagulation  disorders  is  unclear.  Besides,  our  previous  study  has 
shown that in sepsis, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 can affect the coagulation and inflammation systems, resulting 
in fatal damage.28

Thus,  we  hypothesized  that  Eupatilin  can  exert  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-coagulation  effects  in  LPS-induced 

RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP mouse model by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China).

Preparation of Eupatilin
In the in vitro experiments, Eupatilin was dissolved in DMSO to form a stock solution with a final concentration of 10 
mM,  and  stored  at  −80°C.  In  the  in  vivo  experiments,  Eupatilin  was  dissolved  in  80%  corn  oil  and  20%  DMSO  at 
a concentration of 10 mg/mL; the solution was used immediately after preparation.

In vitro
Cell Culture and Intervention
RAW264.7 macrophages were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultivated in DMEM with 10% FBS. 
The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37°C with a 5%CO2 level. Cells were randomly classified into four groups: 
control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + Eup group, and Eup group. The LPS group was stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS 
for 6 hours,30  while the LPS + Eup group was treated with 10 μM Eupatilin for 2 hours, followed by LPS for 6 hours. 
The Eup group was treated only with 10 μM Eupatilin, which was added the same time as LPS+ Eup group.

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay
The effects of Eupatilin on the proliferation of RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. The day 
before stimulation, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.0×104 cells/well. After 24 hours, the 
supernatant was replaced with fresh medium. The CCK-8 solution was then added into each well, and the mixture was 
incubated  at  37°C.  After  2  hours,  the  optical  density  at  450  nm  was  measured  using  a  microplate  reader  (Molecular 
Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).

Real Time Quantitative PCR
In  accordance  with  the  instructions,  the  total  RNA  from  RAW264.7  cells  was  extracted  and  1000  ng  of  RNA  was 
transformed into 20 μL cDNA using the reagents listed above. The cDNA was then stored at -80°C. The RT-qPCR was 
performed  using  SYBR  Green  on  a  PCR  detection  system  (7500fast,  USA).  The  cycling  conditions  were  as  follows: 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 60s, then denaturation at 95°C for 15s, annealing at 60°C for 30s, and extension at 72°C 
for  45s,  the  three  steps  above  cycled  for  40  times.  The  results  were  normalized  to  GAPDH  and  the  statistics  were 
calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The  primer pair  sequences for mice  were from Generay Biotech (Shanghai, China) 
and listed in Table 1.

In vivo
Experimental Animals
We obtained male C57BL/6 mice at the age of 6–8 weeks and the weight of 18–25 g from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory, 
Animal Limited Liability Company (SCXK (ZHE) 2019–0001). According to the local animal welfare policy, the mice 
were raised in a specific pathogen-free laboratory animal environment, in which the temperature maintained at 23 ± 3°C, 
the  humidity  kept  at  55%  ±  10%,  and  the  light/dark  cycle  controlled  at  12:12.  During  the  study,  the  mice  were  fed 
a normal diet. All animal experiments were complied with the requirements of the Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Wenzhou Medical University.  The animal  experimentation protocol  was granted by the Ethics Committee  of Wenzhou 
Medical University (YS2018-088, 2018.02.26).

Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) and Animal Tests
The  mice  were  randomly  assigned  into  three  groups  according  to  the  random  number  table  method:  sham  operation 
(SHAM) group, CLP group, CLP + Eup group. After the processing time, each group contained more than six samples. 
The  mice  were  anesthetized  by  1%  sodium  pentobarbital  (Solarbio,  China)  according  to  their  weight  (100  μL/10  g) 
before operation. After the mice were anesthetized, we opened the abdominal cavity and carefully exposed the cecum, 
which was then ligated at 1 cm from the end and punched through by a needle (21-gauge). Subsequently, the feces were 
squeezed  out  into  the  abdomen  and  the  cecum  was  placed  back.  Finally,  the  abdominal  cavity  was  closed.31  Similar 
procedures  without  ligation  and  puncture  were  used  in  the  SHAM  group.  For  the  CLP+Eup  group,  the  mice  were 
administered  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  by  gavage  2  hours  before  operation.  After  surgery,  each  mouse  was  immediately 
resuscitated  by  subcutaneous  injection  of  1  mL  warm  saline.  The  experimental  samples  were  collected  24  hours  after 
surgery. Besides, survival analysis was performed and lasted for 72 hours, with 10 mice per group, during which the mice 
were monitored every 6 hours and euthanized at the point of moribundity.

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining
The  lung  tissue  from  three  groups  of  mice  were  collected,  fixed  in  4%  paraformaldehyde,  dehydrated,  embedded,  and 
sliced into 4-μm-thick sections. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the slices were stained by H&E staining kit. 
Then,  the  severity  of  lung  injury  was  evaluated  based  on  inflammatory  cell  infiltration,  edema  and  congestion.  The 
pulmonary injury was scored as follows: 0 point for no injury, 1 point for <25% of the field injured, 2 points for 25% to 
50% of the field injured, 3 points for 50% to 75% of the field injured, and 4 points for >75% of the field injured.32  Each 
slide  had  six  microscopic  fields  analyzed,  and  the  average  was  taken  as  the  final  score  for  each  lung  tissue.  Lung 
histological analyses were performed in a blinded manner.

Immunohistochemical Assay
The lung slices were dewaxed and rehydrated. Then, the antigen in slices was retrieved in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) 
for  10  minutes  using  a  microwave  oven,  followed  by  quenching  of  endogenous  peroxidase  for  15  minutes.  Next,  the 
sections  were  blocked  with  5%  BSA  for  an  hour.  The  slices  were  then  incubated  with  rabbit  anti-fibrinogen  antibody 
(Abcam,  Catalog  No:  ab34269)  overnight  at  4°C.  The  next  day,  the  slices  were  incubated  at  37°C  for  1h  with  HRP- 
conjugated  goat  anti-rabbit  antibody.  Subsequently,  the  slices  were  stained  using  a  DAB  kit  and  observed  under 
a microscope.

Elisa Test
The  supernatants  from  RAW264.7  cell  were  collected,  centrifuged  at  1000  ×  g  for  10  minutes  and  stored  at  −20°C. 
Twenty-four hours after surgery, the plasma was collected from mice using anticoagulant tubes with 3.2% sodium citrate. 
The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 minutes and stored at − 80°C. The experiment was performed according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  catalog  numbers  for  the  reagent  kits  were  as  follows:  IL-1β  (Catalog  No:70- 
EK201B),  IL-6  (Catalog  No:70-EK206)  and  TNF-α  (Catalog  No:70-EK282)  from  MultiScience,  China.  TF  (Catalog

Western Blotting
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  lung  tissue  from  mice  were  dissociated  by  RIPA  buffer  with  10%  protein  phosphatase 
inhibitor and 1% PMSF. After measuring the protein concentrations using the BCA kit, lysates containing 20 µg protein 
samples were separated on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After that, the proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF 
membranes  in  a  cold  condition;  these  membranes  were  then  blocked  using  5%  skim  milk  in  1  ×  TBST  buffer  for  1.5 
hours at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. 
On the second day, the membranes were incubated with goat HRP-conjugated IgG antibodies (Catalog No: SA00001-2 
for anti-rabbit or Catalog No: SA00001-1 for anti-mice, Proteintech, China) for 1 hour at room temperature. The proteins 
were then visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence reagent. The primary antibodies were as follows: STAT3 (Catalog 
No:  9139S)  and  p-STAT3  (Try705)  (Catalog  No:  9145S)  from  Cell  Signaling  Technology,  USA.  TF  (Catalog  No: 
DF6400), IL-6 (Catalog No: DF6087), TNF-α (Catalog No: AF7014), IL-1β (Catalog No: AF5103), GAPDH (Catalog 
No: AF7021), Tubulin (Catalog No: AF7011), and Histone H3 (Catalog No: BF9211) are from Affinity, China. p-JAK2 
(pY1007+Y1008) (Catalog  No:  ab32101),  JAK2  (Catalog  No:  ab108596),  thrombin  (Catalog  No:  ab92621) and  PAI-1 
(Catalog  No:  ab222754)  from  Abcam  (Cambridge,  United  Kingdom).  The  internal  reference  proteins  in  this  study 
included GAPDH, Tubulin, and Histone H3. ImageJ software (NIH, USA) was used to quantify the protein bands.

Immunofluorescence
For  cell  immunofluorescence,  macrophages  were  fixed  with  4%  paraformaldehyde  for  10  min,  permeabilized  in  0.2% 
Triton  X-100  for  15  minutes,  and  blocked  in  5%  BSA  for  30  minutes.  All  the  operations  were  performed  at  room 
temperature.  Then,  the  cells  are  incubated  with  p-STAT3  primary  antibodies  overnight  at  4°C,  followed  by  incubation 
with FITC secondary antibodies against the appropriate sources for 1 hour at 37°C (Catalog No: BL031A for anti-mice or 
Catalog  No:  BL033A  for  anti-rabbit,  Biosharp).  Thereafter,  the  sections  were  mounted  using  an  anti-fluorescence 
quencher containing DAPI (Catalog No:36308ES11, Yeasen, China).

For tissue immunofluorescence staining, lung sections were treated the same way as for immunohistochemistry, then 
incubated  with  the  F4/80  (Catalog  No:  sc-377009,  Santa  Cruz)  and  TF  (Catalog  No:  DF6400,  Affinity)  primary 
antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following day, the slides were performed in the same way as for cell immunofluores-
cence.  Finally,  we  visualized  the  fluorescence  signal  in  the  tissue  and  cells  using  a  laser  confocal  microscope  (Nikon, 
Japan). The statistical significance was estimated using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).

Statistical Analyses
GraphPad Prism  9.0.0  (GraphPad  Software,  USA)  was  used  for  the  statistical  analysis. Each  experiment  was  indepen-
dently  carried  out  in  at  least  three  duplicates.  Values  were  presented  as  mean ± SD.  P  <  0.05  was  considered  to  be 
statistically  significant.  After  evaluating  normality  and  variance  in  each  group,  the  group  differences  were  examined 
using  one-way  ANOVA,  followed  by  Tukey’s  post-hoc  multiple  comparison  test.  The  analysis  was  carried  out  to 
determine the statistical methods for comparison between groups. The Log rank test was used to compare the survival 
time in each group of mice.

Effects of Eupatilin on Cell Viability
To assess the effect of Eupatilin on cell viability and cytotoxicity, we examined the effect of Eupatilin on RAW 264.7 
macrophages  using  the  CCK8  assay.  As  shown  in  Figure  1B,  the  cell  viability  of  RAW  264.7  macrophages  was  little 
affected  within  24  hours  at  concentrations  less  than  10μM.  Thus,  in  the  following  experiments,  we  used  a  10μM 
concentration  of  Eupatilin  to  eliminate  any  potential  cytotoxic  effect.  Besides,  the  result  of  CCK8  also  showed  that 
LPS  induced  cell  proliferation  in  macrophages,  while  Eupatilin  could  inhibit  the  LPS-induced  cell  proliferation 
(Figure 1C).

Eupatilin Decreased the Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and TF in LPS-Induced 
RAW264.7 Cells
To explore the effect of Eupatilin, we measured inflammatory cytokines and TF levels in RAW264.7 cells six hours after 
LPS stimulation. As shown in Figure 1D-F, after the stimulation with LPS, the mRNA expression raised sharply in TNF- 
α (25.15±4.10), IL-1β (3753.55±114.04) and IL-6 (36976.14±1121.44). However, pretreatment with Eupatilin apparently 
attenuated  the  LPS-induced  increase  in  inflammatory  cytokine  expression.  TF  is  a  major  promoter  of  coagulation.  As 
shown in Figure 1G, Eupatilin apparently inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression of TF (84.66±4.86 in LPS group vs 
48.49±3.39 in LPS+Eup group)

Western blot and ELISA were performed to examine the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF at the protein 
level. In the supernatants from the LPS group, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were higher than the control 
group, whereas this increase was significantly reduced in the LPS + Eup group (Figure 1H-J, 19,615.96±714.41pg/mL, 
26.24±2.44pg/mL and 2590.58±109.74pg/mL in LPS group vs 17,095.77±140.07pg/mL, 19.10±1.79pg/mL and 1796.74 
±256.63pg/mL  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively).  Moreover,  the  Western  blot  results  illustrated  that  pretreatment  with 
Eupatilin significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 1K-N). Both 
the Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated the reduction in the expression of inflammation indicators in the RAW 
264.7 cells after using Eupatilin. Western blot analysis also revealed a decrease in TF expression in the LPS + Eup group 
(Figure 1K and O).

Eupatilin Regulated LPS-Induced Inflammation and Coagulation by Suppressing JAK2/ 
STAT3 Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells
To  observe  whether  Eupatilin-mediated  effects  on  inflammation  and  coagulation  were  linked  to  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling  pathway,  we  performed  Western  blot  in  RAW264.7  cells  to  detect  the  phosphorylation  of  target  proteins. 
Compared with the CON group, the LPS group had significantly higher expression levels of both p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. 
However,  after  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin,  the  expression  levels  of  both  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  were  diminished 
(Figure  2A-C,  1.48±0.02  and  3.10±0.14  in  LPS  group  vs  1.21±0.06  and  2.38±0.11  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively). 
AG490  is  an  inhibitor  of  JAK2,  which  reduced  the  phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  (Figure  2D).  Western  blot 
analysis  revealed  that  AG490  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  both  STAT3  and  JAK2,  while  Eupatilin  pretreatment 
strengthened this inhibition (Figure 2E-G). Moreover, comparing with CLP group, the use of AG490 could reduce the 
expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TF (Figure 2H-K, 15.09±1.61, 1843.46±85.28, 18,345.62±427.00, and 55.24±1.82 
in  LPS  group  vs  11.71±0.17,  1170.53±41.54,  4321.65±241.26,  and  38.15±3.08  in  LPS+AG490  group,  respectively), 
while the use of Eupatilin strengthened this inhibition.

To  verify  whether  Eupatilin  pretreatment  can  reduce  p-STAT3  nuclear  translocation  in  LPS-stimulated  RAW264.7 
cells,  both  Western  blot  and  immunofluorescence  were  performed.  Western  blot  analysis  showed  that  the  pretreatment 
with  Eupatilin  attenuated  the  expression  of  p-STAT3  in  nucleus  (Figure  3A).  In  addition,  cell  immunofluorescence 
showed  a  reduction  in  the  nuclear  translocation  of  p-STAT3  after  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  in  RAW264.7  cells 
(Figure 3B).

Figure 2 Effects of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells. (A-C) The phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in RAW264.7 cells was analyzed by 
Western  blot.  (D)  The  phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  in  RAW264.7  cells  after  using  AG490  alone  for  7  hours  was  analyzed  by  Western  blot.  (E-G)  The 
phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  in  RAW264.7  cells  after  pretreatment  with  AG490  and  AG490  plus  Eupatilin  were  analyzed  by  the  Western  blot.  The  relative 
expression levels of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were normalized to JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. (H-K) The differences in TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and TF mRNA 
expression were determined by RT-qPCR. Before receiving LPS (1 μg/mL) for 6 hours, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with AG490 (10 µM) for 1 hour. n≥3 per group, one- 
way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, versus LPS group; $ p < 0.05, $$ p < 0.01, $$$ p < 0.001, versus LPS+AG490 
group.

Eupatilin Increased Survival Rate and Improved Inflammation and Coagulation in Septic 
Mice
To investigate the effect of Eupatilin on the survival rate of septic mice, we established a model using CLP with C57BL/6 
mice and calculated the 72-hour survival rate. The results showed that compared with SHAM group, the survival rate in 
CLP group dropped sharply (Figure 4A, 1/10,10% in CLP group vs 10/10,100% in SHAM group). Moreover, compared 
to mice in CLP group, the survival rate in CLP+Eup group increased (5/10, 50%).

Figure 3 Effects of Eupatilin on the translocation of p-STAT3 into the nuclei in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with LPS. (A) The protein levels of p-STAT3 in the nuclei of 
RAW264.7 cells were determined by Western blot. (B) p-STAT3 (green) fluorescence images of RAW264.7 cells (scale bar: 50 µm, 600 ×) were captured under a confocal 
laser microscope. n≥3 per group, one-way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, versus LPS group.

To  explore  whether  Eupatilin  improves  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  mouse  model,  ELISA was  performed.  As 
anticipated,  the  level  of  inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  TNF-α,  IL-1β  and  IL-6  (241.72±30.17pg/mL,  33.59±2.25pg/ 
mL,  213.99±75.66ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  141.52±19.96pg/mL,  25.80±4.05pg/mL,  41.36±17.86ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup 
group,  respectively),  as  well  as  coagulation  factors,  such  as  TF,  TAT,  PAI-1  and  D-dimer  (82.24±4.89pg/mL,  42.79 
±8.39ng/mL,  233.75±82.02ng/mL,  31.80±3.14ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  68.21±  2.50pg/mL,  12.60±2.90ng/mL,  23.91 
±21.07ng/mL,  23.33±1.78ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup  group,  respectively),  were  lower  in  the  plasma  for  mice  in  CLP+Eup 
group (Figure 4B-H) than those in the CLP group. In addition, compared with the SHAM group, the fibrinogen level in 
plasma  was  decreased  in  the  CLP  group,  while  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  reversed  this  trend  (Figure  4I,  497.13 
±21.69µg/mL in CLP group vs 705.19±138.68µg/mL in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Eupatilin Alleviated Pulmonary Inflammation and Lung Injury in Septic Mice
We performed H&E staining to detect lung injury. H&E staining revealed that in the CLP models, the alveolar wall was 
thickened, hyaline membranes were formed, and neutrophils had accumulated in the interstitial space. As anticipated, the 
CLP+Eup group exhibited slighter lung tissue injury (Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines in 
lung tissue among the three groups was analyzed. As shown in Figure 5B-E, Eupatilin reduced the expression of TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue of mice. Macrophages initiate the primary inflammatory process, and F4/80 is a biomarker 
for them. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the CLP group had stronger F4/80 fluorescent signals than the 
sham group, while Eupatilin pretreatment decreased these signals (Figure 5F).

Eupatilin Reduced Coagulation and Fibrin Deposition in the Lung Tissue of Septic Mice
We used Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to investigate whether Eupatilin reduces 
coagulation  in  lung  tissue.  The  exposure  of  TF  is  the  way  to  promote  coagulation.  The  results  of  Western  blot  and 
immunofluorescence showed that Eupatilin could lower the exposure of TF in the lung tissue of septic mice (Figure 6A, 
B  and  E). Furthermore,  Western blot showed  decreased  expression  levels of  thrombin,  and PAI-1  in the lung  tissue  of 
septic mice after Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 6A, C and D). Additionally, according to immunohistochemistry results, 
fibrin deposition (brown stain) was observed in the CLP group. However, the amount of fibrin deposition was less in the 
lung tissue from mice pretreated with Eupatilin (Figure 6F).

Eupatilin Suppressed the Activation of JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway in the Lung 
Tissue of Septic Mice
To explore the effect of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we extracted proteins from the lung tissue of septic mice. 
The  Western  blot  analysis  revealed  that  the  expression  of  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  was  considerably  higher  in  the  CLP 
group than in the SHAM  group, and decreased  with  Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 7A-C,  1.79±0.24 and  2.21±0.20 in 
CLP group vs 1.24±0.16 and 1.11±0.15 in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Discussion
One  of  the  pathological  features  of  sepsis  is  the  hyperactivation  of  inflammation  and  coagulation  systems;  both  can 
promote  and  impact  upon  each  other.33  In  the  present  study,  we  found  that  Eupatilin  reduced  the  expression  of 
inflammatory  factors  and  tissue  factors  in  LPS-induced  RAW264.7  cells  in  vitro  and  increased  the  survival  of  CLP 
mice. In vivo, Eupatilin attenuated lung injury and reduced inflammatory infiltration and coagulation activation in CLP

mice.  In  summary,  our  research  revealed  that  Eupatilin  could  protect  septic  mice  from  lung  injury,  by  improving 
inflammation and coagulation, and that this protection was linked to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Ample evidence suggests extensive interaction between inflammation and coagulation, with inflammation activating 
coagulation  and  coagulation  greatly  influencing  inflammatory  activity.34  In  sepsis  patients,  high  concentrations  of 
cytokines  can  be  found  in  blood  circulation.15  The  first  mediator  identified  is  TNF,  which  is  then  followed  by  various 
IL with noticeably elevated levels—IL-6 and IL-1 being the most significant.35 Our research showed that, in both in vivo 
and in vitro sepsis models, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were increased.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines have the ability to stimulate coagulation in vitro. TF is the main factor in the coagulation 
process  and  is  also  a  link  between  coagulation  and  inflammation.36–39  Under  normal  physiological  conditions,  mono-
cytes,  endothelial  cells  and  epithelial  cells  have  low  TF  expression.40  However,  during  sepsis,  these  cells  express  and 
release TF into circulation after being stimulated by inflammatory factors and LPS.13,41  Besides, after LPS stimulation, 
caspase-11 is activated, followed by gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores formed and phosphatidylserine exposure, triggering 
the  coagulation  cascade.42  Previous  research  has  also  demonstrated  that  blocking  IL-6  inhibits  endotoxin-induced 
coagulation  activation.43  Numerous  investigations  have  shown  that  the  stimulation  of  human  monocytes  with  LPS 
increases  TF  expression.40,44  Moreover,  healthy  humans  who  received  a  low-dose  endotoxemia  injection  had  a  125- 
fold increase in the amount of TF mRNA in their circulating monocytes.45,46  In a model of endotoxemia, early research 
showed  that  inhibiting  the  expression  of  TF  attenuated  septic  shock,  and  animals  with  low  TF  levels  had  decreased

Figure 7 Effects of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in lung tissue of septic mice. (A-C) The phosphorylation levels of JAK2 and STAT3 in septic mice were 
analyzed by Western blot. The relative expression levels of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were normalized to JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. n≥3 per group, one-way

coagulation,  inflammation,  and  mortality.47  In  our  study,  we  discovered  that  TF  expression  was  noticeably  higher  in 
sepsis models, while the pretreatment with Eupatilin reversed these changes.

After  the  release  of  TF,  it  binds  to  activated  factor  VII(VIIa),  forming  the  TF–FVIIa  complex,  which  can  induce 
a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages.48  The TF–VIIa complex then activates factor X and initiates coagulation 
activation.  Factor  Xa,  together  with  factor  Va,  forms  the  prothrombinase  complex,  which  subsequently  converts 
prothrombin  to  thrombin.49  It  can  amplify  inflammation  by  binding  to  platelets  and  protease  activated  receptor  1 
(PAR-1).50  Thrombin  then  cleaves  fibrinogen  into  fibrin,51  and  fibrin  degradation  products can  induce  IL-6  production 
by monocytes in vitro.52  Moreover, fibrin degradation can elevate the levels of D-dimer. This process produces higher 
levels of PAI-1, and the overproduction of which will impair fibrinolysis.53  Increased fibrin formation due to impaired 
fibrinolysis causes organ injury and mortality in sepsis.54

According to a number of studies, the STAT3 signaling pathway can regulate inflammatory responses in LPS-induced 
macrophages  and  acute  lung  injury,  including  the  production  and  release  of  inflammatory  factors.55–58  In  our  previous 
study, we found that activation of the nuclear transcription factor STAT3 through phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 site 
induced TF expression and facilitated the onset of coagulation dysfunction in sepsis.28 In addition, the use of the STAT3 
inhibitor BP-1-102 decreased the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TF 
in RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, our present experiments detected phosphorylation of STAT3 in both mice lung tissue and 
LPS-stimulated macrophages sepsis models, and increased intranuclear phosphorylation was found in macrophages, both 
of which are in agreement with previous studies.29

However,  other  mechanisms  may  also  be  involved  in  Eupatilin’s  effects.  Studies  have  shown  that  Eupatilin  is 
a  selective  PPARα-receptor  agonist,  the  activation  of  PPARα  may  be  related  to  the  alleviation  of  inflammation  and 
oxidative  stress  in  LPS-induced  ALI.23,59  Eupatilin  has  also  been  found  to  reduce  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
cytokines by inhibiting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).60  However, whether it has specific receptors requires further study. 
In addition, Eupatilin may also play a role in other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, MAPK and Nrf2 pathways.24,61 
Thus,  whether  these  pathways  also  play  a  role  in  regulating  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  sepsis  needs  further 
investigation.  According  to  one  study,  Eupatilin  can  lower  the  expression  of  inflammatory  mediators  by  inhibiting  the 
NF-κB signaling pathway in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages.62  However, the specific mechanism of its regulation of 
macrophages and its effect on pathogens has not been elucidated yet.

In our study, we found that the effect of Eupatilin pretreatment on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and tissue 
factors  was  consistent  in  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  experiments.  Eupatilin-mediated  effects in  vivo  were  maintained  in 
both plasma and lung tissues. Moreover, the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was observed in both lung 
tissue and cells after Eupatilin pretreatment. Similar to Eupatilin, another plant-based molecule, piperlongumin, also has

regulatory effects on inflammation and  coagulation in severe infections,  and further studies are needed to  compare the 
effects of these compounds.29

However, our study also has some limitations. First of all, endothelial cells also play an important role in inflamma-
tion and coagulation disorders caused by sepsis. However, we did not perform analysis on endothelial cells in the present 
study. Secondly, the study was performed only in C57BL/6 mice and was not validated in other murine species. Finally, 
we only used a single dose and intervention time in our study, so further studies should be conducted to investigate the 
optimum concentration and intervention time for Eupatilin-related effects.

Conclusion
Our results confirmed that Eupatilin can reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factors in both 
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  mouse  sepsis  models.  It  also  increased  survival  and  attenuated  lung  injury  in  mice  with 
sepsis.  The  mechanism  for  this  may  involve  the  inhibition  of  JAK2/STAT3  activation  and  the  reduction  of  p-STAT3 
nuclear  translocation,  thereby  regulating  inflammatory  cytokines  and  coagulation  factors.  Additionally,  the  potential 
mechanisms and effects of Eupatilin on other organs in sepsis require further investigation.

Pretreatment with Eupatilin Attenuates Inflammation and Coagulation in Sepsis by Suppressing JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway

Yilun Lu, Ding Li, Yueyue Huang, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongmin Zhou, Fanrong Ye, Hongjing Yang, Tingting Xu, Shichao Quan &amp; Jingye Pan

Purpose: Sepsis is an aggressive and life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by infection. Excessive inflammation and coagulation contribute to the negative outcomes for sepsis, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. In this study, we explored whether Eupatilin could alleviate lung injury, reduce inflammation and coagulation during sepsis. 

Methods: We constructed an in vitro sepsis model by stimulating RAW264.7 cells with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 hours. The cells were divided into control group, LPS group, LPS+ Eupatilin (Eup) group, and Eup group to detect their cell activity and inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factor levels. Cells in LPS+Eup and Eup group were pretreated with Eupatilin (10μM) for 2 hours. In vivo, mice were divided into sham operation group, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group and Eup group. Mice in the CLP and Eup groups were pretreated with Eupatilin (10mg/kg) for 2 hours by gavage. Lung tissue and plasma were collected and inflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors and signaling were measured.  

Results: In vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tissue factor (TF) expression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells was downregulated by Eupatilin (10μM). Furthermore, Eupatilin inhibited phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and suppressed p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. In vivo, Eupatilin increased the survival rate of the mice. In septic mice, plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as TF, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and fibrinogen were improved by Eupatilin. Moreover, Eupatilin alleviated lung injury by improving the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF, fibrin deposition and macrophage infiltration in lung tissue.  

Conclusion: Our results revealed that Eupatilin may modulate inflammation and coagulation indicators as well as improve lung injury in sepsis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

     <document section>
Western blot and ELISA were performed to examine the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF at the protein 
level. In the supernatants from the LPS group, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were higher than the control 
group, whereas this increase was significantly reduced in the LPS + Eup group. Moreover, the 
Western blot results illustrated that pretreatment with 
Eupatilin significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells. Both 
the Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated the reduction in the expression of inflammation indicators in the RAW 
264.7 cells after using Eupatilin. Western blot analysis also revealed a decrease in TF expression in the LPS + Eup group.

Eupatilin Regulated LPS-Induced Inflammation and Coagulation by Suppressing JAK2/ 
STAT3 Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells
To observe whether Eupatilin-mediated effects on inflammation and coagulation were linked to the JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway, we performed Western blot in RAW264.7 cells to detect the phosphorylation of target proteins. 
Compared with the CON group, the LPS group had significantly higher expression levels of both p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. 
However, after pretreatment with Eupatilin, the expression levels of both p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were diminished. 
AG490 is an inhibitor of JAK2, which reduced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Western blot analysis revealed 
that AG490 inhibited the phosphorylation of both STAT3 and JAK2, while Eupatilin pretreatment strengthened this 
inhibition. Moreover, comparing with CLP group, the use of AG490 could reduce the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 
and TF, while the use of Eupatilin strengthened this inhibition.

To verify whether Eupatilin pretreatment can reduce p-STAT3 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 
cells, both Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed. Western blot analysis showed that the pretreatment 
with Eupatilin attenuated the expression of p-STAT3 in nucleus. In addition, cell immunofluorescence 
showed a reduction in the nuclear translocation of p-STAT3 after the pretreatment with Eupatilin in RAW264.7 cells. 

Eupatilin Increased Survival Rate and Improved Inflammation and Coagulation in Septic 
Mice
To investigate the effect of Eupatilin on the survival rate of septic mice, we established a model using CLP with C57BL/6 
mice and calculated the 72-hour survival rate. The results showed that compared with SHAM group, the survival rate in 
CLP group dropped sharply. Moreover, compared to mice in CLP group, the survival rate in CLP+Eup group increased.  

To explore whether Eupatilin improves inflammation and coagulation in mouse model, ELISA was performed. As 
anticipated, the level of inflammatory cytokines, as well as coagulation factors, were lower in the plasma for mice in 
CLP+Eup group than those in the CLP group. In addition, compared with the SHAM group, the fibrinogen level in 
plasma was decreased in the CLP group, while the pretreatment with Eupatilin reversed this trend.

Eupatilin Alleviated Pulmonary Inflammation and Lung Injury in Septic Mice
We performed H&E staining to detect lung injury. H&E staining revealed that in the CLP models, the alveolar wall was 
thickened, hyaline membranes were formed, and neutrophils had accumulated in the interstitial space. As anticipated, the 
CLP+Eup group exhibited slighter lung tissue injury. Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue 
among the three groups was analyzed. As shown, Eupatilin reduced the expression of TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue of mice.  

Eupatilin Reduced Coagulation and Fibrin Deposition in the Lung Tissue of Septic Mice
We used Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to investigate whether Eupatilin reduces 
coagulation in lung tissue. The exposure of TF is the way to promote coagulation. The results showed that Eupatilin could 
lower the exposure of TF in the lung tissue of septic mice. Furthermore, Western blot showed decreased expression levels of 
thrombin, and PAI-1 in the lung tissue of septic mice after Eupatilin pretreatment. Additionally, according to 
immunohistochemistry results, fibrin deposition was observed in the CLP group. However, the amount of fibrin deposition was 
less in the lung tissue from mice pretreated with Eupatilin.  

Eupatilin Suppressed the Activation of JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway in the Lung 
Tissue of Septic Mice
To explore the effect of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we extracted proteins from the lung tissue of septic mice. 
The Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 was considerably higher in the CLP 
group than in the SHAM group, and decreased with Eupatilin pretreatment.

Purpose: Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes citrullination, a post-translational
modiﬁcation that can alter structure, function and antigenicity of proteins. Citrullination in
the lungs due to smoking is believed to initiate an anti-citrulline immune response in
rheumatoid arthritis. Citrullination in other inﬂamed organs has also been demonstrated,
but it is not known whether smoking or inﬂammatory processes in general result in release of
relevant amounts of PAD into the circulation with potential to cause citrullination of proteins
at various anatomical sites. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) induces an acute systemic inﬂammation response. In the present study, we
investigate whether smoking or acute systemic inﬂammation causes release of PAD into the
circulation.
Patients and methods: This study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease (16
smokers and 20 non-smokers) undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Circulating levels of
PAD2 and PAD4, PAD activity,
the neutrophil activation markers MPO, MMP-9 and
lipocalin-2, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL8 were measured 2 hrs
preoperatively and 2 hrs postoperatively.
Results: At baseline, serum PAD2 and PAD4 concentration did not differ between smokers
and non-smokers. However, serum from non-smokers contained higher PAD activity than
serum from smokers. Circulating PAD2 levels and PAD activity increased markedly in both
groups after surgery, as did all neutrophil activation markers, cytokines and chemokine.
PAD2 levels correlated with neutrophil activation markers, but not with cytokine and
chemokine levels.
Conclusion: Blood levels of PAD2 did not differ signiﬁcantly between smokers and non-
smokers, but smokers had decreased PAD activity in the circulation. PAD2 levels and
PAD activity increased in blood during inﬂammation induced by CABG with CPB. This
suggests that acute inﬂammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or a combination of these,
leads to systemic spreading of enzymatically active PAD, which may affect protein
function and induce generation of citrullinated self-antigens.

Introduction
Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the post-translational protein modiﬁcation
known as citrullination, which refers to the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline
residues. Citrullination can alter the function of several proteins, including cytokines and
chemokines,1,2 ﬁbrinogen,3 nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase4 and transforming growth

factor-β,5 and induce structural changes in proteins that gen-
erate autoantigenic neoepitopes, as observed in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and type I diabetes.6,7 The human PAD enzyme
family has ﬁve members (PADs 1–4 and 6), of which PAD2
and PAD4 are expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin, eg,
monocytes, lymphocytes and granulocytes.8 Neutrophils are
considered a major source of PAD2 and PAD4,9–11 and PAD
released from neutrophils is capable of citrullinating extracel-
lular proteins.10,12 Prerequisites for PAD activation are a high
calcium concentration, which is found in the extracellular
space,13 and a redox potential that maintains the catalytic site
in a reduced state.10,14 PAD and citrullinated proteins are
abundant in the lungs of smokers and are suspected to be the
initial source of citrullinated proteins that cause the anti-
citrulline immune response involved in RA.15–17 Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease18 and periodontitis19 are other
inﬂammatory conditions associated with
examples of
increased local levels of citrullinated proteins. Indeed, protein
citrullination appears to occur in inﬂammation in general.20
However, it is not known whether inﬂammation leads to
release of PAD into the bloodstream, which may potentially
cause citrullination of proteins in the circulation or at distant
anatomical sites, thereby generating antigens that ignite auto-
immune reactions.

is

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass
an example of
(CPB)
a circumstance where acute systemic inﬂammation occurs,
partly due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after aortic
unclamping leading to activation of endothelial cells and
neutrophils, and partly because neutrophils are activated
after contact with artiﬁcial surfaces of the cannula and
tubing connecting the patient to the CPB system.21–24

We investigate here whether smoking is associated
with increased levels of circulating PAD2 and PAD4, or
with increased PAD activity. Moreover, we examine
whether acute inﬂammation such as that
induced by
CABG surgery can lead to the release of enzymatically
active PAD into the systemic circulation.

Material and methods
Patient selection
The study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease
who underwent conventional elective CABG at
the
Department of Thoracic Surgery, Copenhagen University
Hospital Rigshospitalet. Patients below 18 years of age,
pregnant women, and patients with cancer, autoimmune dis-
orders or chronic inﬂammatory disorders were excluded.

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The smokers
included (n=16) had all smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes
per day for at least 5 years and had smoked in the 48 hrs
before surgery. The non-smokers (n=20) had all smoked
<100 cigarettes ever. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee H-3-2014-164 and was per-
formed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and
all patients gave written informed consent.

antihypertensives

Preoperative medication
All patients had their aspirin and antiplatelet drugs paused
before the surgery. All patients were receiving treatment
antihypercholesterolemic
and
with
agents before the surgery. Patients with type 2 diabetes
were receiving treatment with either insulin or oral anti-
diabetics. One patient was receiving treatment with the
anti-inﬂammatory prednisolone (2.5 mg) before surgery.

Anesthesia
Anesthetic management was standardized. No premedica-
tion was given. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and
propofol infusion. Propofol, sevoﬂuran and remifentanil
were titrated thereafter. Cisatracurium was administered
before tracheal
intubation. Some patients were given
bolus CaCl and noradrenaline when coming off the CPB.
Corticosteroids were not used in any of the patients during
perioperative management. Cefuroxime (1.5 g) and genta-
micin (240 mg) were given perioperatively.

Surgical procedure
All CABG procedures were performed via a median ster-
notomy, and on-pump with CPB and extracorporeal circu-
lation (ECC). Patients were fully heparinized to maintain
an acquired coagulation time above 480 s. This effect was
reversed with protamine sulfate (1:1) after ﬁnalization of
ECC. Cardiac arrest was achieved with cold blood cardi-
oplegia, and ECC was performed under normothermia.
Standard anesthetic techniques were used, and intra-
operative monitoring was in accordance with guidelines.
Standard guidelines for anti-coagulation therapy were
followed.

Serum sampling
Blood samples were drawn 2 hrs before surgery and 2 hrs
after surgery (from the closure of the skin) in 6 mL dry
tubes (VACUETTE, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen,
Germany), from which serum was isolated.

Measurements of serum cytokines,
markers of neutrophil activation and PAD
Serum IL-6, IL-10 and CXCL-8 were measured using the
Cytometric Bead Array Human Inﬂammatory Cytokine Kit
II (Cat. no. 551811) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) after dilution of 5 µL serum in 20 µL PBS
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A FACS
Canto II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for
data acquisition, and the FCAPArray Software (SoftFlow,
Burnsville, MN, USA) was used for analysis. Neutrophil
activation markers were measured in serum diluted 1:50 in
sample diluent following the manufacturer’s instructions
using the Luminex Bio-Plex® 200 system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by means of the one-
plex myeloperodidase (MPO) assay (R&D, Abingdon,
UK), and the two-plex MMP-9 and lipocalin-2/NGAL
(R&D) assay. PAD2 was measured using an in-house PAD2-
speciﬁc assay on a Luminex platform.25 In brief, the murine
monoclonal anti-PAD2 antibody DN2 was coupled to beads,
and patient serum diluted 1:3 in sample buffer was added.
After washing, biotinylated anti-PAD2 antibody DN625 and

PE-labelled streptavidin were used for detection. CV% of
spiked controls were <15%. PAD4 was measured in undi-
luted serum using a commercially available ELISA kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SEF709Hu
[N-terminal version], Cloud-Clone, TX, USA). Ability to
detect PAD4 speciﬁcally was conﬁrmed by spiking of
rhPAD2 or rhPAD4 into serum, but low recovery (<10%)
was observed.

three washes, wells were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 mins at room temperature.
Serum was added (50 μL/well) and incubated for 4 hrs at RT,
with or without 1 mM DTT and/or 25 mM EDTA. After three
washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the wells were
incubated for 90 mins with 100 μL of murine anti-

Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences
between groups using GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-rank test was used to determine differences
before and after surgery. Spearman’s correlation (Rs)

coefﬁcients and levels of signiﬁcance were determined
using GraphPad Prism. Two-tailed probability values
<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Determination of circulating PAD2 and
PAD4 levels
We observed no signiﬁcant difference in PAD2 or PAD4 levels
between smokers and non-smokers before or after surgery
(Figure 1A, B, D, and E). The circulating PAD2 levels of
nearly all participants increased during surgery; the median
level before surgery was 0.3 ng/mL (10–90 percentile range:
0.1–1 ng/mL) compared to 1.15 ng/mL (0.3–5.12 ng/mL) after
surgery (p<0.0001) (Figure 1C). We found no signiﬁcant

Catalytic activity of circulating PAD
We next tested whether the circulating PAD was enzy-
matically active and observed higher PAD activity in
serum from non-smokers than in serum from smokers
before surgery (Figure 2A), which we did not expect.
This difference was also present after surgery (Figure
2B). Since smoking has been reported to cause oxida-
tion of GSH and cysteine in the blood,26 we examined

whether PAD activity could be restored by addition of
DTT, an exogenous
reducing agent. PAD activity
increased in both groups after addition of DTT, but the
activity remained lower in smokers than in non-smokers
(Figure 2C). As illustrated in Figure 2D, CABG surgery
caused a marked increase in catalytic activity of circu-
lating PAD in nearly all patients tested, both for smo-
kers and non-smokers (p<0.001).

Effect of CABG surgery on inﬂammatory
mediators and neutrophil degranulation
To determine whether the increase in PAD2 levels and PAD
activity observed during CABG surgery reﬂected the state
of inﬂammation, we quantiﬁed circulating levels of the pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine IL-6, the anti-inﬂammatory cyto-
kine IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL-8 (Figure 3A–C).
The levels of all three molecules increased after surgery
(Figure 3A–C). To address the degree of neutrophil activa-
tion, we quantiﬁed MPO, MMP-9 and lipocalin-2, as mar-
kers of degranulation of the primary, secondary and tertiary
granules, respectively. The levels of all three markers were
elevated after surgery (Figure 3D–F).

Before surgery, the levels of PAD2 did not correlate
with any of the biomarkers, whereas a signiﬁcant corre-
lation was found between circulating PAD2 and MPO
levels after surgery (p=0.03; Table 2). After surgery, we
observed a trend toward correlation between PAD2 and
the two other markers of neutrophil activation, whereas
no association was observed with IL-6, IL-10 or CXCL-
8. When the basal levels of all six biomarkers before
surgery were subtracted from those observed after sur-
gery (shown as “ΔSurgery” in Table 2), the change in
circulating PAD2 levels correlated with the changes in
both MPO and lipocalin-2 levels, but not with the
change in IL-6,
IL-10 or CXCL-8. No associations
were observed between PAD4 and the six biomarkers
before or after surgery (data not shown).

with human ﬁbrinogen were incubated for 4 hrs with sera from 36 patients who had

Discussion
Citrullination alters the function and antigenicity of
many proteins2,4,27 and is thought
to play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases,
especially RA.7 Citrullination in this respect is thought
to occur at the very sites of PAD release, eg, in the
lungs, periodontal tissue or gut.15,19,28 In this study, we
put forward the hypothesis that PAD is released into the
circulation following smoking or acute inﬂammation.

PAD2 was present in detectable concentrations in the
blood from most patients before surgery, and was found to
be markedly increased after surgery. This was not the case
for PAD4 levels. We have previously found detectable
blood levels of PAD2 in less than a third of normal
blood donors,25 but to our knowledge, no other studies
have examined circulating PAD2 in relation to disease or
inﬂammation. Although smokers tended to have slightly

higher blood levels of PAD2 than non-smokers, there was
a great overlap between our groups. Increased amounts of
PAD2 along with increased numbers of macrophages have
previously been shown in the lungs of smokers.16,17 Our
data indicate that this PAD2 enters the bloodstream to only
a limited extent. This may be because it does not cross the
alveolar epithelium or is rapidly degraded locally. It is also

sufﬁciently stimulated for PAD release before blood sam-
pling in this study.

Importantly, the PAD contained in the serum samples
was enzymatically active in many cases. Thus, PAD
inﬂammation
released into the circulation during local
may citrullinate extracellular proteins, which potentially
modify their functional properties or render proteins anti-
genic. Surprisingly, we found that the PAD contained in
the blood of smokers was less active than that of non-
smokers. The PAD activity of serum from smokers could
be restored by addition of the reducing agent DTT, which
suggests that PAD is inactivated by oxidation in the blood
of smokers, presumably by reactive oxygen species
released as a consequence of smoking.26 It is possible
that circulating inactive PAD can be reactivated at anato-
mical sites with a reducing environment. Thus, PAD activ-
ity can be restored in synovial ﬂuid from RA patients after
addition of a reducing agent,10 but to our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst time that catalytic activity has been observed in
serum without addition of reducing agents.

The fact that only PAD2 levels increased during surgery
in this study suggests that PAD2 is predominantly responsi-
ble for the observed PAD activity in the blood. Neutrophils
are a predominant source of PAD2 and PAD4,9,10,12 and our
ﬁnding that the increase in PAD2 levels during surgery
correlated with the increase in neutrophil activation markers –
but not with changes in proinﬂammatory cytokines – is in
keeping with this. This agrees with previous ﬁndings that
extracellular activity of PAD released from neutrophils
in vitro is primarily mediated by PAD2.29 PAD2 is rapidly
released from neutrophils on stimulation,12 and with blood
sampling 2 hrs after surgery, it is likely that the PAD2
released during the surgical procedure was pre-formed rather
than synthesized de novo. The measurements of PAD4 in this
study should be interpreted with caution, however, since low
recovery was observed in the PAD4 ELISA after spiking of
PAD4 into serum.

CABG surgery is based on the use of the CPB, which is
known to induce ischemia, neutrophil activation, and
a systemic inﬂammatory response which exceeds that
observed after other major surgical procedures.21,23 We cannot
rule out that the neutrophil activation observed in this study and
any consequent PAD release were caused by sheer mechanical
stress or hypoxia. However, extracellular PAD activity is
observed as a consequence of inﬂammatory stimuli,30 so we
propose that PAD2 release and an increase in circulating PAD
activity are features of acute inﬂammation in a broader sense.
This remains to be tested in other inﬂammatory conditions.

Conclusion
PAD2 is released into circulation during CABG surgery
with CPB, and the PAD released is enzymatically active.
The increase in PAD2 levels correlated with an increase in
neutrophil activation markers, indicating that neutrophils
were the predominant source of PAD2. Smoking had no
statistically signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on circulating PAD2
levels, and the catalytic activity of circulating PAD was
unexpectedly decreased among smokers. The implications
of this remain to be investigated.

Release of active peptidylarginine deiminase into the circulation during acute inflammation induced by coronary artery bypass surgery

Anne Vejlstrup, Ann Merete Møller, Claus Henrik Nielsen, and Dres Damgaard

Abstract

Purpose: To investigate whether peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) is released into the circulation following smoking or acute inflammation induced by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

Methods: Serum samples were collected from 36 patients undergoing CABG surgery. Levels of PAD2, PAD4, PAD activity, neutrophil activation markers, cytokines, and chemokines were measured before and after surgery and compared between smokers (n=16) and non-smokers (n=20). 

Results: PAD2 levels and activity significantly increased after surgery in both groups but did not differ between smokers and non-smokers. However, non-smokers had higher PAD activity at baseline. The increase in PAD2 correlated with increases in neutrophil activation markers but not cytokine levels.  

Conclusion: Acute inflammation induced by CABG surgery causes systemic release of enzymatically active PAD2, likely from activated neutrophils. This may potentially lead to extracellular citrullination and generation of neoantigens.

The inﬂammatory response is an adaptive mechanism that evolved to ﬁght against
infections and tissue damage. This complex mechanism is vital for the proper function of
the organism, and because of that, is under tight regulation involving a complex network
of factors, cells, and systems. Physiological inﬂammation is perfectly orchestrated to allow
the mobilization of leukocytes from the circulation to the injured tissues for the removal of
pathogens, tissue repair, and return to homeostasis. However, when the self-limited nature
of the inﬂammatory response and the mechanisms of resolution fail, inﬂammation might
become chronic, leading to the development of many disabling serious diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), or psoriasis.

Knowledge of the molecular and cellular processes underlying chronic inﬂammation
has substantially increased in recent decades. This resulted in enormous improvements in
the treatments for immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases, but also revealed the com-
plexity of the cytokine networks and immune cell subtypes involved in non-resolving
inﬂammatory responses. This fact could explain, in part, why certain groups of patients
are totally or partially refractory to current therapies. Therefore, we cannot be satisﬁed
with the available drugs, and more research focusing on deciphering the precise molecular
pathways behind uncontrolled inﬂammation is mandatory for developing novel therapeu-
tic approaches.

The 34 original and review articles included in this Special Issue contributed to the
aim of describing and understanding new mechanisms that trigger inﬂammation and
highlighted new putative treatments for different inﬂammatory conditions.

Neuroinﬂammation is a perfect example of the two faces of inﬂammation. While an
acute inﬂammatory response is protective, chronic neuroinﬂammation leads to inﬂamma-
tory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and it also contributes to other neurological [1]
and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [2]. Microglia is piv-
otal for regulating central nervous system inﬂammation. Therefore, it would be interesting
to develop therapeutic strategies conducted to mitigate their hyperactivation. Following
that aim, Saliba et al. synthesized a new antagonist for the orphan G-protein coupled
receptor 55, which decreased the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduced the activation
of pro-inﬂammatory signalling pathways [3]. In line with this, other receptors regulating
microglia function are being explored. This is the case for some purinergic receptors such
as P2Y receptors, whose actions on microglia and neuroinﬂammation were elegantly re-
viewed by Gómez Morillas et al. [4]. These data highlight that the isolation of new receptors
that can be pharmaceutically targeted might be relevant for treating neuroinﬂammatory
disorders. Actually, a similar approach is followed for other immune-mediated patholo-
gies, in which the inhibition of various receptors such as sodium-glucose co-transporter
2 [5], angiotensin receptor [6], or toll-like receptors [7] is being tested for controlling the

exacerbated inﬂammatory response during acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection, heart
failure, etc.

Focusing on autoimmune responses, Amend et al. [8] and Carvalheiro et al. [9] in-
vestigated the effects of IL-10 and angiopoietin-2 in the context of lupus and systemic
sclerosis, respectively. The former shed light on the poorly understood role played by
IL-10 in the development of lupus, revealing that IL-10 outcome depends on the complex
interplay among the different immune cells and the inﬂammatory microenvironment. The
latter investigated, for the ﬁrst time, how angiopoietin-2 can increase the production of
pro-inﬂammatory mediators by monocytes from systemic sclerosis patients, which could
contribute to the development of ﬁbrotic processes in the skin of those patients. Fibrosis is
also a key feature in chronic kidney injury, and Leong et al. [10] functionally demonstrated
in experimental acute kidney injury mouse models that cyclophilin inhibition protects from
renal injury and ﬁbrosis, an observation that is accompanied by reduced innate immune
cell inﬁltration.

Inﬂammation signiﬁcantly contributes to skin malignancies, as reviewed by
Ansary et al. [11] and Razib Hossain et al. [12]. Interestingly, Yang et al. [13] demonstrated
in vitro and in vivo the therapeutic potential of the natural small molecule neferine as an
anti-inﬂammatory drug for atopic dermatitis. Moreover, Hathaway-Schrader et al. [14]
showed new insights for a better comprehension of the immune evasion in melanoma cells.
Historically, inﬂammation-related research mainly comprised studies related to im-
mune cells and inﬂammatory mediators. However, in recent years, more multidisciplinary
and integrative approaches have been applied for the dissection of the inﬂammatory pro-
cess [15]. This is the case for the article by Weiss et al. [16], which showed an interesting
view of the participation of histone deacetylases in the activation of pro-inﬂammatory
signalling cascades and mediators in cultured macrophages. Moreover, another work
explored the methylation status of speciﬁc promoters for their participation in neuronal
inﬂammatory diseases. Hypermethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is
commonly observed in brain tumours. However, Teuber-Hanselmann et al. [17] reported
an original hypermethylation of that gene in inﬂammatory conditions affecting the central
nervous system. Likewise, the participation of adipokines and obesity in regulating in-
ﬂammation and cardiovascular disease [18,19] and the impact of the YAP/TAZ signalling
in the immunomodulatory responses of tumours [20] have also been discussed. Of note,
Götz et al. [21] demonstrated in vivo the relevance of the complement system in the recruit-
ment of neutrophils and M2-polarised macrophages to ischemic tissues, which, most likely,
are the most relevant players in the observed improvement of angiogenesis.

The impact of environmental factors such as pollutants, microparticles, or endocrine
disruptors is gaining interest. The latter is not only relevant for their interference with
the normal function of the endocrine system, but endocrine disruptors can also partici-
pate in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (as reviewed
by Cano et al.) by modulating liver metabolism [22]. In the same way, the food additive
titanium dioxide worsened experimental colitis in mice carrying IBD genetic risk muta-
tions [23], suggesting that the ingestion of industrial compounds can be detrimental to
patients with IBD with an increased genetic predisposition. Silicon dioxide is well-known
for causing lung silicosis, and novel pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment options
were reviewed by Adamcakova et al. [24]. Interestingly, Wang et al. [25] demonstrated the
efﬁcacy of a novel class of pharmacological compounds, namely SUL-151, in decreasing
neutrophilia after cigarette smoke exposure in mice.

This Special Issue also contains translational studies demonstrating the association
between high concentrations of IL-6 receptor antagonist and reduced carbohydrate dis-
orders and NAFLD progression in obese individuals [26], the impairment of circulating
monocytes and the aberrant production of pro-inﬂammatory mediators in spinal cord
injury patients [27], and the existence of a ﬁbroinﬂammatory signature in human follicular
ﬂuid of the female reproductive system [28]. Furthermore, Di Paola et al. [29] showed
the effects of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist Eltrombopag in the differentiation of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8392

macrophages obtained from children with immune thrombocytopenia. Altogether, these
data show, in the human setting, how inﬂammation can also be at play in conditions not
typically recognised as immune-mediated diseases.

Finally, in this compilation of articles, we ﬁnd very interesting reviews updating a wide
variety of topics such as hypoalbuminemia as a surrogate of infections [30], the resolution
of inﬂammation in IBD or pain [31,32], the impact of inﬂammation in liver tumorigene-
sis and alcohol disease [33,34], and nutraceutical supplementation in obesity-associated
disorders [35]. Moreover, Rafael-Vidal et al. reviewed the potential use of calcineurin in-
hibitors to treat lupus nephritis [36], and the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating
osteoporosis after spinal cord injury were described by Shams et al. [37].

We hope the lectors will appreciate reading these papers. We thank all the authors and
reviewers for their dedication and proactive participation that made the realisation of this
remarkable Special Issue possible.

The inflammatory response is an adaptive mechanism that evolved to fight against infections and tissue damage. This complex mechanism is vital for the proper function of the organism, and because of that, is under tight regulation involving a complex network of factors, cells, and systems. Physiological inflammation is perfectly orchestrated to allow the mobilization of leukocytes from the circulation to the injured tissues for the removal of pathogens, tissue repair, and return to homeostasis. However, when the self-limited nature of the inflammatory response and the mechanisms of resolution fail, inflammation might become chronic, leading to the development of many disabling serious diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or psoriasis.  

Knowledge of the molecular and cellular processes underlying chronic inflammation has substantially increased in recent decades. This resulted in enormous improvements in the treatments for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, but also revealed the complexity of the cytokine networks and immune cell subtypes involved in non-resolving inflammatory responses. This fact could explain, in part, why certain groups of patients are totally or partially refractory to current therapies. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the available drugs, and more research focusing on deciphering the precise molecular pathways behind uncontrolled inflammation is mandatory for developing novel therapeutic approaches.

The 34 original and review articles included in this Special Issue contributed to the aim of describing and understanding new mechanisms that trigger inflammation and highlighted new putative treatments for different inflammatory conditions.  

Neuroinflammation is a perfect example of the two faces of inflammation. While an acute inflammatory response is protective, chronic neuroinflammation leads to inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and it also contributes to other neurological [1] and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [2]. Microglia is pivotal for regulating central nervous system inflammation. Therefore, it would be interesting to develop therapeutic strategies conducted to mitigate their hyperactivation. Following that aim, Saliba et al. synthesized a new antagonist for the orphan G-protein coupled receptor 55, which decreased the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduced the activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways [3]. In line with this, other receptors regulating microglia function are being explored. This is the case for some purinergic receptors such as P2Y receptors, whose actions on microglia and neuroinflammation were elegantly reviewed by Gómez Morillas et al. [4]. These data highlight that the isolation of new receptors that can be pharmaceutically targeted might be relevant for treating neuroinflammatory disorders. Actually, a similar approach is followed for other immune-mediated pathologies, in which the inhibition of various receptors such as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [5], angiotensin receptor [6], or toll-like receptors [7] is being tested for controlling the exacerbated inflammatory response during acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection, heart failure, etc.

Focusing on autoimmune responses, Amend et al. [8] and Carvalheiro et al. [9] investigated the effects of IL-10 and angiopoietin-2 in the context of lupus and systemic sclerosis, respectively. 

The former shed light on the poorly understood role played by IL-10 in the development of lupus, revealing that IL-10 outcome depends on the complex interplay among the different immune cells and the inflammatory microenvironment. The latter investigated, for the first time, how angiopoietin-2 can increase the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by monocytes from systemic sclerosis patients, which could contribute to the development of fibrotic processes in the skin of those patients.

Introduction: Chronic inflammation is a pernicious underlying status, well-known for its contribution to the progressive development 
of various diseases. In this regard, Micro-immunotherapy (MI) might be a promising therapeutic strategy. MI employs low doses (LD) 
and ultra-low doses (ULD) of immune regulators in their formulations. In particular, as both IL-1β and TNF-α are often used at ULD 
in MI medicines (MIM), a special emphasis has been made on formulations that include these factors in their compositions.
Methods: Several in vitro models have been employed in order to assess the effects of two unitary MIM consisting of ULD of IL-1β 
and TNF-α (u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2, respectively), and four complex MIM (c-MIM-1, −2, −3 and −4) characterized by the presence of 
ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α amongst other factors. Thus, we first investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2 in 
a model of inflamed colon carcinoma cells. In addition, the anti-inflammatory potential of c-MIM-1, −2, −3 and −4, was assessed in 
in vitro models of intestinal and neuronal inflammation.
Results: The results revealed that u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2 both induced a slight decrease in the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α transcripts. 
Regarding the c-MIMs’ effects, c-MIM-1 displayed the capability to restore the altered transepithelial electrical resistance in inflamed- 
HCoEpiC cells. Moreover, c-MIM-1 also slightly increased the expression of the junction-related protein claudin-1, both at the mRNA 
and protein levels. In addition, our in vitro investigations on c-MIM-2 and c-MIM-3 revealed their immune-modulatory effects in LPS- 
inflamed human monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, on the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-α, PGE2, and IL-6. Finally, 
c-MIM-4 restored the cell viability of LPS/IFN-γ-inflamed rat cortical neurons, while reducing the secretion of TNF-α in rat glial cells.
Discussion: Our  results shed  the  light  on  the  potential role  of  these  MIM  formulations in  managing  several chronic  inflammation- 
related conditions.

Introduction
Inflammatory  mechanisms  are  part  of  the  normal  body’s  defense  against  aggressions,  however,  when  they  last  for 
prolonged periods of time (months to years), they can induce a chronic inflammatory state that can be detrimental to the 
organism.1 The etiology of such slow and long-lasting inflammation is very heterogeneous, as multiple causes can trigger 
an  over-activation  of  the  immune  system,  inhibiting  at  the  same  time  its  normal  return  to  homeostasis.  Besides  the 
context  of  auto-immune  disorders,  some  of  the  reasons  that  can  perpetuate  a  low-grade  inflammation  could  be:  (i)  the 
organism’s inability to eliminate infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses or parasites, (ii) its prolonged exposure to low

levels of chemicals, biochemicals or irritants, (iii) defects in the activation/inactivation mechanisms of the immune cells 
including an inadequate or insufficient resolution of inflammation or (iv), lifestyle stressors such as poor sleep quality or 
nutrition.  If  those  triggers  are  maintained  over  a  long  period  of  time,  they  can  lead  to  chronic  inflammatory-related 
diseases  that  can  involve  many  other  organs  and  tissue  of  the  body  like  the  gut,  driving  inflammatory  bowel  diseases 
(IBD);  the  cardio-vascular  system  (stroke,  atherosclerosis);  the  brain  (depression,  neurodegenerative  diseases);  the 
immune system (auto-immune diseases and cancer); the endocrine-metabolic system (diabetes and obesity).

Numerous treatment strategies have been employed in order to reduce inflammation and immunotherapies are one of 
them.  For  instance,  the  use  of  cytokine-based  therapies  has  been  reported  in  the  management  of  sepsis,  diabetes,  or 
cardiovascular  diseases  with  quite  promising  results.  However,  unwanted  side  effects  still  remain,  probably  due  to  the 
cytokines or immune factors dosages employed. A therapeutic approach that includes micro-immunotherapy (MI) could 
thus be of great interest in order to face such concerns. Indeed, MI medicines (MIM) are immune-factor-based medicines, 
which formulations either encompass a sole active substance (unitary preparations; referred to as u-MIM) or a distinctive 
combination of several ingredients (complex MIM; referred to as c-MIM). These medicines are manufactured in the form 
of sucrose-lactose pillules impregnated with the corresponding active ingredients, for oromucosal administration, and are 
intended  to  be  taken  in  a  fasted  state.  In  this  manner,  the  active  substances  can  reach  the  oral-pharyngeal  mucosal 
immune system,2 as well as the mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with their associated lymphoid 
tissues and cell populations of the innate and adaptative immune responses.3  This route of administration will, in turn, 
elicit systemic and local effects, as we could observe in previous published preclinical in vivo studies.4–6

Through their exclusive preparation, MIM aim at gently modulating the expression and the related signaling pathways 
of cytokines and immune factors by providing to the organism these molecules at low doses (LD) and ultra-low doses 
(ULD) (Figure 1). These LD/ULD are expressed in Hahnemannian dilution (CH) or in Korsakovian dilutions (K). LD of 
bioactive  molecules  (ranging  from  3  to  5  CH)  are  used  in  MI  formulations  to  mimic  the  low  doses  occurring  in  the 
organism,7,8 and are employed to induce their own biological effects, stimulating their functions (Figure 1, green part). The 
recently published preclinical study on the unitary interferon-γ (4 CH) indeed shows how, at cellular levels, the drug elicits 

Figure 1 General scheme of the concept of low doses (LD) and ultra-low doses (ULD) in the context of MI supported by the two cited preclinical research studies referring 
to the immune-stimulatory/anti-inflammatory responses elicited by the LD or ULD, respectively. LD of cytokines, ranging from 3 centesimal Hahnemannian (CH) to 5 CH, 
aim at orienting the immune responses towards an immune stimulation, inducing their own biological effect through mimicking the physiological low doses employed in the 
body. The immune-stimulatory effects of IFN-γ (4 CH) have been reported by Jacques et al 2022.7 On the other side of the spectrum, ULD aim at modulating (from 6 CH)/ 
down-regulating  (from  12  CH  and  beyond)  a  response.  For  instance,  the  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  employed  at  27  CH,  exerted  anti-inflammatory 
responses (Floris et al 2020).9 The CH numbers represented on the x-axis are the ones employed in the MIM’s formulations studied in the current manuscript. The arrows

immunostimulatory and co-stimulatory effects on different cell types.7 On the other side, the use of ULD (from 6 CH up to 
30  CH)  employed  in  MI  is  intended  to  modulate  (from  6  CH)  and/or  down-regulate  (from  12  CH  and  beyond)  the 
expression of the concerned active substances (Figure 1, orange part). Interestingly, we previously reported that the two 
unitary medicines (u-MIM) interleukin (IL) 1β (IL-1β) (27 CH) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (27 CH) displayed 
anti-inflammatory properties, as they both exhibit the potential to inhibit the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α, in a model of 
human  primary monocytes as  well as in  THP-1 cells, after  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure (Figure 2A, blue box).9 

Figure 2 (A) The rationale of the present study is based on the fact that ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α are employed in the tested MI medicines (MIM). The anti-inflammatory 
role of these cytokines, when used at 27 CH, under the respective form of unitary MIM (u-MIM) has been reported by Floris et al 2020,9 and Jacques et al 2021,11 in a model 
of inflamed-immune cells (blue box) consisting of LPS-inflamed human primary monocytes and THP-1 cells. In the current study, the effects of these u-MIM were appraised in 
an intestinal model of inflammation (red box; see Results Section 1., for the results). (B) Scheme recapitulating the overall organization of the present manuscript regarding

Moreover, other in vitro and in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of a MI formula-
tion employing ULD of TNF-α and IL-1β in association with other immune regulators,4,10,11 providing encouraging results 
about the potential of some MIM in slowing down the pro-inflammatory responses in the context of chronic inflammation. 
Based on these previous results, the first aim of this study was to assess the effects of these two ULD-based u-MIMs in 
another specific inflammatory context, an intestinal inflammation model (Figure 2A, red box).

In  contrast  to  unitary  preparations,  complex  MI  formulations  consist  of  a  unique  association  of  active  substances, 
thought to act synergistically in order to coherently channel a specific biological response. The second aim of this study 
was to conduct a complementary assessment of the effects of four c-MIM (referred to as c-MIM-1, c-MIM-2, c-MIM-3 
and c-MIM-4 in this manuscript), as they all employ ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α in their formulations, in association with 
additional  actives  at  LD/ULD.  c-MIM-1  also  includes  ULD  of  IL-8  and  LD  of  IL-10;  c-MIM-2  includes  ULD  of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-6, with LD of IL-10, too; c-MIM-3 uses ULD of IL-6, IL-13 and oncostatin M (OSM), 
as well as LD of tumor growth factor β (TGF-β) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Finally, c-MIM-4 employs ULD 
of IL-6 and IL-12 as well as LD of IL-4 (Figure 2B).

It  is  now  well-recognized  that  chronic  inflammation  triggers  a  whole-body  response  and  the  activation  of  many 
feedback loops with interconnected effects.12  Moreover, as an integrated and complex system, the different anatomical 
parts of the body communicate between them. Considering the particularly close relationship between the epithelial cells 
from the gut, the immunity and the nervous system,13  the main purpose of this study was indeed to assess the potential 
anti-inflammatory  properties  of  four  different  complex  MIM’s  (c-MIM)  formulations  in  several  inflammatory  contexts 
related to the (i) -intestinal tract (Figure 2B, red box), (ii) -immune axis (Figure 2B, blue box) and (iii) -nervous system 
(Figure 2B, yellow box), depending on their specific cytokines combination. The further paragraphs of this introduction 
will  provide  brief  non-exhaustive  detail  about  the  role  of  each  cytokine  in  the  three  above-mentioned  contexts,  thus 
explaining the deliberate choice to assess each c-MIM in a particular inflammatory model in the first place.

Recent literature delineated the importance of IL-8 and IL-10 in the molecular mechanisms driving GI inflammatory 
diseases.14,15 The fact that c-MIM-1 includes ULD of IL-8 and LD of IL-10 in its formulation thus motivated the choice 
of assessing the cellular effects of this medicine in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation (Figure 2B, red box).

In a more general approach, c-MIM-2 and c-MIM-3 have been investigated in vitro, on the immune axis in different 
cell types and inflamed experimental contexts (Figure 2B, blue box). These two formulations employ ULD of IL-1β and 
TNF-α in association with ULD of PGE2, or ULD of IL-6, IL-13, and OSM, and LD of IL-10, or LD of TGF-β and IL- 
1Ra. Numerous publications, nicely put together in the review from Tsuge et al indeed reported the major role played by 
PGE2 in the mediation of inflammation and immune diseases, notably through its implication in mechanisms related to 
Th1 differentiation, and Th1/Th17/Th22 signaling.16  In the context of immunity, IL-10 is produced by a broad type of 
myeloid  and  lymphoid  cells  during  infections,  and  suppresses  macrophages  and  dendritic  cells  functions,  thereby 
impeding Th1 and  Th2  effector responses.17  In  immune effector cell types, and  in a wide  range of  established models 
of chronic inflammation, IL-10 is reported to play a central role in the regulation of homeostasis.18 On another side, TGF- 
β is  important  in  maintaining the  T cell  tolerance to  self  or  innocuous  environmental  antigens.19  IL-1 is  known  for  its 
crucial  involvement  in  the  onset  and/or  the  etiopathogenesis  of  several  inflammatory-mediated  diseases.  Given  its 
importance,  several  therapeutic  approaches  consisting  of  the  use  of  IL-Ra  have  been  used  in  clinical  practice  to  block 
the activity of IL-1.20  OSM is a pleiotropic cytokine playing important roles  in a wide range of homeostatic functions 
(such as hematopoiesis, bone/fat turnover, liver regeneration) and, under chronic inflammatory diseases, it may play pro- 
inflammatory  roles,  depending  on  the  microenvironment  and  the  interested  tissue,  without  being  overexpressed  at 
systemic  levels.21  IL-6  is  also  a  pleiotropic  cytokine  playing  important  roles  in  hematopoiesis,  bone  metabolism 
embryonic  development,  immunity,  and  host  responses.  Its  expression  is  finely  regulated  at  multiple  levels,  and  when 
a dysregulated and persistent IL-6 expression occurs, it may lead to the development of various inflammatory-mediated 
diseases.22,23  Similarly,  IL-13  is  known  to  exert  pleiotropic  effects  and  to  be  involved  in  inflammatory-mediated 
diseases.24

Finally, in the case of c-MIM-4, which employs ULD of both IL-6 and IL-12 in its formulation, as well as IL-4 at LD, 
one  of  the  goals  of  this  study  was  to  assess  its  effects  using  an  in  vitro  preclinical  model  of  neuronal  inflammation 
(Figure 2B, yellow box). The rationale behind the choice of the neuronal-inflammation context was supported by a rich

bibliography,  illustrated  by  the  following  examples.  For  instance,  according  to  the  results  of  a  recent  meta-analysis, 
patients suffering from depressive symptoms express higher levels of IL-6.25  Another study also reported that the IL-12 
serum  levels  of  patients  with  major  depression  were  significantly  higher  than  healthy  controls,  and  that  an  8-weeks 
treatment led to a reduction of these levels.26 On the other hand, it was suggested that IL-4 could modulate IL-1β-induced 
depressive behavior in rats, by inhibiting IL-1β-induced central glial activation and neurotransmitter alterations.27

Materials and Methods
Tested Item and Experimental Control
The tested MIMs are homeopathic medicinal products consisting of sucrose-lactose pillules impregnated with ethanolic 
preparations  of  cytokines.  These MIMs  were  manufactured  by  Labo’Life  España,  as  previously  described,6,7  and  have 
been provided for investigational purposes. The two u-MIM under investigation in this study (referred as u-MIM-1 and 
u-MIM-2)  are  presented  as  unitary  medicines,  while  the  four  tested  complex  capsules  (c-MIM-1,  c-MIM-2,  c-MIM-3, 
and  c-MIM-4)  are  made  of  a  specific  combination  of  either  four,  five  or  seven  different  ingredients  (Figure  2).  Their 
composition is characterized by cytokines and immune factors and their amount is expressed in CH or in K.

The  Veh.  pillules  used  in  the  study  as  controls  are  manufactured  by  Labo’Life  Belgium.  Previous  publications 
described how these vehicle controls are produced, in order to provide a suitable control for preclinical research.4,6,7,9,10 
Regarding  the  in  vitro  experiments  performed  in  the  current  study,  u-MIM,  c-MIM  or  the  Veh.  pillules  were  freshly 
diluted in 100 mL of culture medium to reach the final sucrose-lactose concentration of 11 mM.

Cell Lines
HT-29- cells, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line with epithelial morphology was used in this study. This cell 
line  was  purchased  from  the  ATCC  (ATCC®  HTB-38™,  Molsheim,  France)  and  was  grown  in  Dulbecco’s  Modified 
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with high glucose (4.5 g/L) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (DMEM 10% FCS, PAA 
Laboratories,  Les  Mureaux,  France)  and  antibiotics  (streptomycin  100  μg/mL  and  penicillin  100  units/mL,  Sigma 
Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2  and 95% relative humidity.

To  induce  inflammatory  conditions,  a  pre-stimulation  of  cells  by  TNF-α  (ref  #  39–8329-60/E08250-1633, 
eBioscience) at 10 ng/mL was performed for 3 hours. The tested Veh. and MIMs were then added to the culture medium 
containing  the  TNF-α  for  24  more  hours  before  an  extensive  wash,  and  harvested  for  mRNA  extraction.  Supernatants 
(SN) were collected to perform cytokine quantification by ELISA.

Evaluation of Gene Expression by RT-qPCR
Total  mRNA was  isolated  from  cells  using  Rneasy  kit  (Macherey  Nagel,  Hoerdt,  France)  according  to  the  manufac-
turer’s instructions. RNA quantification was performed using spectrophotometry. After treatment  at 37°C for 30  min 
with  20–50  units  of  RNase-free  DNase  I  (Roche  Diagnostics  Corporation,  Indianapolis,  IN,  USA),  oligo-dT  primers 
(Roche  Diagnostics  Corporation,  Indianapolis,  USA),  the  High-Capacity  cDNA  Reverse  Transcription  Kit  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Waltham,  MA,  USA)  was  used  to  synthesize  single-stranded  cDNA.  The  mRNA was  quantified  using 
SYBR  green  Master  Mix  (Applera,  Courtaboeuf,  France)  with  human-specific  oligonucleotides  in  a  GeneAmp 
Abiprism 7000 (Applera). In each assay, calibrated and no-template controls were included. Each sample was run in 
triplicate.  SYBR  green  dye  intensity  was  analyzed  using  the  Abiprism  7000  SDS  software  (Applera,  Courtaboeuf, 
France). All results were normalized to the unaffected housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH).

All the results are expressed as a fold of the mean of activation of duplicate/mean of duplicate in medium alone or 
TNF-α alone. The primers sequences used are the following: GAPDH: Forward (F): 5’-GAC ACC CAC TCC TCC ACC 
TTT-3’;  Reverse  (R):  5’-TTG  CTG  TAG  CCA  AAT  TCG  TTG  T-3’;  TNF-α:  F:5’-CAG  GAC  GTG  GAG  CTG  GCC

Inflamed Colon Epithelial Intestinal Cells Model
Phytohemagglutinin-Stimulated Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell’ Supernatants Production
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adult volunteer donors were isolated by centrifugation 
of  venous  blood  on  Ficoll-Hypaque  density  gradients  (Amersham  Pharmacia  Biotech,  Piscataway,  NJ,  USA).  Healthy 
volunteers were enrolled by the Blood Bank Center (Etablissement Français du Sang, EFS, Pays de Loire, France). All 
blood  samples  were  approved  by  the  Ethics  committee  of  the  EFS  Blood  Bank  Center  with  written  informed  consent 
obtained  for  all  the  donors,  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki.  Cells  (105/mL)  were  cultured  in  24-well 
round-bottom  plates  in  2  mL  of  complete  medium  and  stimulated  with  phytohemagglutinin  (PHA)  (5  µg/mL)  for  48 
hours. The SN were collected and stored at −80°C until use.

Trans-Epithelial Resistance Assessment in Human Colonic Epithelial Cells
Human Colonic Epithelial Cells (HCoEpiC) were purchased from Innoprot, Bizkaia, Spain. The cells were seeded at the 
density of 5×105 cells in 24-well plate inserts whose diameter is 6.5 mm and the membrane area 0.3 cm2 and grown until 
tight confluence. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. 
The  trans-epithelial  resistance  (TEER)  measurements  were  obtained  as  Ω/cm2  and  performed  with  a  Millicell®  ERS-2 
device  at  different  incubation  times  (24  hours  and  72  hours),  in  the  presence/absence  of  the  PBMC  SN,  with/without 
c-MIM-4  or  Veh.  added  30  minutes  before  reading.  The  measurements  were  performed  in  HBSS  without  phenol  red 
(Sigma-Aldrich, ref # H6648), adding 600 µL HBSS in the basolateral area and 100 µL of HBSS in the apical area for 30 
minutes.  After  this  time,  readings  in  3  individual  wells  (n  =  3)  were  made.  10  mM  of  sodium  caprate  (C10)  (Sigma- 
Aldrich, ref # C4151) was used as a positive control.

Claudin-1 Expression Assessment in Human Colonic Epithelial Cells
HCoEpiC cells were seeded at a density of 500.000 cells/well in 6 well plates and grown until confluence. HCoEpiC cells 
were treated with or without Veh. or c-MIM-1 for 24 h. After that, 400 μL of human PBMC SN previously activated with 
PHA during 48 h was added to each well for 30 minutes. After treatments, the cells were collected and divided into two 
parts, one part was used for mRNA isolation and the other part for protein extraction.

Evaluation of the Claudin-1 Expression by Real-Time qPCR
For  quantitative  reverse  transcriptase-PCR  assays,  total  RNA  (1  µg)  was  retrotranscribed  using  the  iScript  cDNA 
Synthesis Kit  (Ref #1708891,  Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA,  USA)  and  the cDNA was  analyzed  by real-time  PCR  using the 
iQTM  SYBR  Green  Supermix  (Ref  #1708880,  Bio-Rad)  and  a  CFX96  Real-time  PCR  Detection  System  (Bio-Rad). 
GAPDH gene expression was used to standardize mRNA expression in each sample. Gene expression is quantified using 
the 2−ΔΔCt  method and the percentage of relative expression against controls (untreated cells) was represented. Primers

Evaluation of the Claudin-1 Expression by Western Blot
The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and proteins were extracted in 50 μL of lysis buffer (50 mM 
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% NP-40) supplemented with 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ 
mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL pepstatin and aprotinin, and 1 μL/mL phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) saturated. Twenty  
micrograms of protein were boiled at 95°C in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed in 10% SDS/PAGE gels. Separated 
proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (20V for 30 min) and blocked in tris-buffered 
saline  (TBS)  solution  containing  0.1%  Tween  20  and  5%  non-fat  dry  milk  for  1 hour  at  room  temperature. 
Immunodetection of specific proteins was carried out by incubation with a primary antibody rabbit anti-Cldn-1 (1:200, 
Ref: #ab15098, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and β-actin (1:10.000 dilution, Ref: #A5316, Sigma), overnight, at 4°C. After 
washing  membranes,  horseradish  peroxidase-conjugated  secondary  antibody  was  added  and  detected  by 
a  chemiluminescence  system  (GE  Healthcare  Europe  GmbH,  Freiburg,  Germany).  The  quantification  of  the  Blot’s 
pictures, was performed thanks to the online version of the ImageJ software (downloaded on the 2nd of May 2022).

Immunomodulation in Immune Cells
Immunomodulation in Human Monocytes
Human primary monocytes were prepared from buffy coats of three healthy human blood donors. All blood samples were 
approved  by  the  Ethics  committee  of  the  EFS  Blood  Bank  Center  with  written  informed  consent  obtained  for  all  the 
donors.  Cells  were  seeded  in  24-well  plates  at  a  density  of  2.200.000  cells/well  for  ELISA  measurements.  Monocytes 
were incubated with LPS (10 ng/mL, Salmonella typhimurium SL1181) for 30 min before treatment with either the Veh., 
or c-MIM-2 for an additional 24 hours. After 24 hours, SN were collected, centrifuged, and investigated for IL-1β, TNF- 
α and PGE2 concentrations in ELISA using the manufacturer’s protocol (n = 6, 3 different donors).

Immunomodulation in Human Macrophages
Human  CD14+  monocytes  were  isolated  from  the  blood  of  a  healthy  donor  (67  years  old  man).  The  blood  sample 
collection was approved by the Ethics committee of the EFS Blood Bank Center. After the mononuclear cells’ isolation 
by  the  Ficoll  gradient  centrifugation  method,  the  CD14+  cells  were  selected  by  positive  selection  thanks  to  magnetic 
beads (MACS®  Miltenyi Biotec B.V. and Co. KG, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Monocytes were then cultivated for 6 
days  in  24-well  plates,  with  α-MEM  medium  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  and  100  ng/mL 
macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  (M-CSF)  (R&D  Systems,  Inc.,  Minneapolis,  MN,  USA,  Ref:  #216-MC).  After 
these 6 days in culture, the medium was replaced with α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 ng/mL M-CSF in 
addition to 100 ng/mL LPS (Sigma, Ref: #L4391) and either the Veh. or c-MIM-3. The treatments were applied for 24 
hours and each condition was performed in triplicate. At the end of the incubation period, SN were collected, aliquoted, 
and  stored  at  −80°C  until  ELISA  assay  (human  IL-6  Quantikine,  R&D  Systems).  Optic  density  was  measured  on 
a  spectrophotometer  Multiskan  Go  and  the  Skanlt  3.2  software  was  used  to  quantify  the  measured  cytokine 
concentrations.

Immunomodulation in Human Granulocytes
Human primary granulocytes were freshly isolated from the blood of a healthy donor obtained from the EFS, and seeded 
in 48-well plates in optimized RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated FBS. Cells were then pre-incubated with 
either  Veh.,  or  c-MIM-3  for  one  hour,  before  the  addition  of  LPS  (1  µg/mL)  as  the  inflammation  inducer  within  the

were  performed  in  triplicate.  At  the  end  of  the  total  incubation  period,  SN  were  collected  and  the  assessed  cytokines

Cortical Neurons Culture
Rat cortical neurons were cultured as described by Singer et al28  Briefly, a pregnant female rat of 15 days gestation was 
sacrificed by CO2  inhalation (Wistar; Janvier Lab, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and the fetuses were removed from the 
uterus.  The  cortexes  were  removed  and  placed  in  ice-cold  medium  of  Leibovitz  (L15,  Panbiotech  GmbH,  Aidenbach, 
Germany, Ref: #P04-27055 batch: 8940719) containing 2% of penicillin/streptomycin (PS, PanBiotech Ref: #P06-07100, 
batch:  2791019)  and  bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA,  Panbiotech  Ref:  #P06-1391100,  batch:  H190110).  Cortexes  were 
dissociated  by  trypsin-EDTA  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Illkirch-Graffenstaden,  France  Ref:  #25300-054,  batch: 
2027082)  for  20  min  at  37°C.  The  reaction  was  stopped  by  the  addition  of  DMEM  (Panbiotech  Ref:  #P04-03600,

FCS (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Ref: #10270106, batch: 42G2082K). Cells were then mechanically dissociated by 
3 passages through a 10 mL pipette. Cells were then centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The SN was discarded and 
the cell pellet was re-suspended in a culture medium for neurons consisting of Neurobasal (Invitrogen, Ref: #11570556, 
batch:  2161553)  supplemented  with  2%  of  B27  (Invitrogen,  Ref:  #11530536,  batch:  2181375),  2  mM  of  L-glutamine 
(L-glut; PanBiotech, Ref: #P04-80100, batch: 1640518), 2% of PS solution, 1% of FCS and 10 ng/mL of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Peprotech France, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Ref #450-02, batch 31961). Viable cells were 
counted in a Neubauer cytometer using the trypan blue exclusion test. The cells were seeded at a density of 30.000 cells/ 
well  in  96  well-plates  (Falcon,  ref:  353072)  pre-coated  with  poly-D-lysine  (10  µg/mL;  Sigma,  ref:  P7886,  batch: 
SLBS8705) in H2O culture (PanBiotech ref: P04-991000, batch: 2900219) and were cultured at 37°C in a humidified air 
(95%)/CO2  (5%) atmosphere.

Preparation of Astrocytes and Microglial Cell and Culture with Cortical Neurons
One vial of rat glial cells (4.000.000 cells by vial at passage 2) was thawed and cells were seeded at the density of 12.000 
cells per cm² on 75 cm² flask (Nunc ref: 055403) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM of L-glutamine, 2% of PS solution 
and 10% of FCS. After 5 days of culture, the mix of astrocytes/microglial cells was dissociated by trypsin-EDTA for 20 
min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DMEM, containing DNAase I grade II (0.1 mg/mL) and 10% 
FCS. Cells were then centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min at 4°C temperature. The cell pellet was re-suspended in a culture 
medium for neurons. Glial cells were seeded at the same time as the neurons at a density of 20.000 cells per well.

Compound Incubation and LPS/IFN-γ Treatment
After  8  days  of  coculture,  cells  were  treated  with  either  Veh.,  c-MIM-2,  or  MK801  (Sigma  ref:  M107,  batch: 
105M4606V)  at  20  µM  in  medium  for  neurons.  After  9  days  of  coculture,  cells  were  treated  with  or  without  the 
combination of LPS (100 ng/mL, Sigma ref: L2630, batch: 089M4016V)/IFN-γ (10 ng/mL, Peprotech ref: 315–05, batch: 
061798) during 24 hours,29–31  and with or without the tested items or MK801 in 300 µL of medium for neuron. At the 
end of this 24 hours incubation, SN were recovered and frozen for quantification of TNF-α released. Cortical neurons and 
glial cells were incubated in a medium for neurons with and without the tested items for an additional 48 hours to analyze 
the survival of neurons. Six independent wells were done per culture condition.

Quantification of Neuronal Cells Survival After Glial Cells LPS/INF-γ Activation
After 72 hours of glial cells LPS/INF-γ activation, cells were fixed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, ref: 
6148, batch: SZBE2390V) for 20 min at room temperature, and control conditions were also fixed according to the same 
procedure. The cells were then permeabilized and non-specific sites were blocked with a solution of PBS (PanBiotech; 
ref: P04-36500, batch: 5081219) containing 0.1% of saponin (Sigma; ref: S7900, batch: BCBL8667V) and 1% FCS for 
15  min  at  room  temperature.  Cells  were  incubated  overnight  at  4°C,  with  a  monoclonal  anti-microtubule  associated 
protein  2  antibodies  produced  in  mice  (MAP-2,  1/5000,  Sigma;  ref:  M4403,  batch:  063M4802),  in  a  solution  of  PBS 
containing 1%  FCS  and 0.1% saponin.  Antibody against  MAP-2 stains specifically  neuron cell  body and  neurite. This 
antibody  was  revealed  with  an  Alexa  Fluor  488  goat  anti-mouse  IgG  (1/400,  Molecular  probe,  ref:  A11001,  batch: 
2140660)  in  PBS  with  1%  FCS  and  0.1%  saponin,  for  1  hour,  at  room  temperature.  Nuclei  of  cells  were  labeled  by 
a fluorescent marker (Hoechst solution, Sigma; ref: B1155, batch: 046M4048V) in the same solution. For each condition, 
20  pictures  per  well  were  taken  using  InCell  Analyzer  2200  (GE  Healthcare)  with  20x  magnification.  Images  of  each 
culture well were taken in the same conditions. Analysis of cell bodies of MAP-2 positive neurons was performed using 
Developer  software  (GE  Healthcare).  A  total  of  6  data  per  experimental  condition  were  provided.  All  values  are 
expressed as mean ± s.e.m.

Quantification of Cytokine Release by ELISA
The  culture  SN  were  thawed  and  100  µL  by  well  were  used  to  quantified  by  ELISA  the  level  of  TNF-α  (TNF-α  rat 
ELISA  kit,  Fisher  Scientific,  ref:  KRC3011,  batch  218247–002)  released  by  glial  cells  in  the  media,  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s instructions. All values are expressed as mean ± SD.

Statistical Analysis
The graphs in the figures were performed with GraphPad Prism, Version 9.4 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San 
Diego California USA, updated on 16/06/2022). Authors have followed the recent recommendations of D.L. Vaux that 
encourage performing descriptive statistics instead to make statistical inferences when the number of independent values 
is small.32 Indeed, no statistical inference has been performed to analyze the results of the in vitro studies presented here.

Results
IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH), Both Unitary Micro-Immunotherapy Medicines, 
Slightly Reduced the Expression of IL-1β and TNF-α at Transcriptional Levels in TNF- 
α-Inflamed HT-29 Cells
Previous  results  reported  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  the  u-MIM  IL-1β  (27  CH)  and  TNF-α  (27  CH)  in  human 
primary monocytes and in the THP-1 cell line.9 In this study, we wanted to assess the effect of these unitaries in a model 
of intestinal inflammation, by using a human epithelial colon cancer cell line exposed to TNF-α. Therefore, the effect of 
IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH) was evaluated in HT-29 cells, inflamed by a 3 hours pre-incubation with 10 ng/mL 
TNF-α (Figure 3A). The cells were then treated with either the vehicle (Veh.), IL-1β (27 CH) or TNF-α (27 CH) for 24 
hours  before  assessing  the  transcripts’  expression  of  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  by  RT-qPCR.  The  results  are  presented  in 

Figure 3 IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH) tend to decrease the expression of both IL-1β and TNF-α at transcriptional levels, in a model of intestinal inflammation. (A) 
Representative scheme of the experimental protocol. HT-29 cells were pre-treated for 3 hours with 10 ng/mL TNF-α as an inflammatory trigger before the incubation with

3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal normalizer. The black dotted lines highlight the effect of the two tested u-MIM compared with the Veh.

Figure  3B  and  C,  and  the  control  (Ct)  conditions  showed  that  the  mRNA  expression  of  both  of  the  cytokines  was 
increased  after  TNF-α  stimulation  (Figure  3,  white  vs  red  histograms).  A  decrease  of  more  than  two-fold  in  IL-1β 
expression was obtained after IL-1β (27 CH) treatment compared with the Veh. (Figure 3, grey vs orange histograms). In 
addition,  a  decrease  in  TNF-α  expression  of  about  two-fold  too  was  also  observed  in  the  same  treatment  conditions. 
Similar  response  patterns  towards  a  down-regulation  were  observed  after  treatment  with  the  other  u-MIM,  TNF-α  (27 
CH)  (Figure  3,  grey  vs  yellow  histograms).  Considering  these  interesting  trends,  the  following  sections  of  this  study 
aimed  at  evaluating  the  anti-inflammatory  properties  of  several  complex  MIM-containing  ULD  of  IL-1β  and  TNF-α 
within their formulations.

c-MIM-1 Could Restore the Transepithelial Resistance in a Cellular Model of Intestinal 
Inflammation
The  integrity  of  the  intestinal  barrier  is  fundamental  to  maintain  healthy  gut  homeostasis,  as  well  as  physiological 
intestinal permeability. It is widely known that, under chronic inflammation, intestinal homeostasis is altered, resulting in 
an impairment of the barrier functions and thus, an increase in intestinal permeability.33  In order to induce an intestinal 
inflammation status in vitro, human HCoEpiC cells were exposed to supernatants (SN) derived from phytohemagglutinin 
(PHA)-treated PBMCs, which have been reported to be concentrated in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8 
and IL-17.34  The resistance of the epithelial barrier is one of the characteristics that reflects the intestinal permeability 
and the interactions’ strength between epithelial cells. As a consequence, any disruption within these epithelial interac-
tions  ultimately  creates  a  so-called  “leakage”  in  the  barrier,  leading  to  the  symptoms  related  to  inflammatory  bowel 
diseases.  Transepithelial  electrical  resistance  (TEER)  measurements,  expressed  in  Ω/cm,2  were  performed  with  a  -
Millicell®  ERS-2  device,  after  either  a  24-hours  or  a  72-hours  incubation  period,  with/without  PHA-treated-PBMCs 
SN, with/without either the Veh. or c-MIM-1, added 30 minutes before the SN (Figure 4A). 10 mM of sodium caprate 
(C10)  was  used  as  a  positive  inducer  of  the  epithelial  barrier  disruption  and  served  as  an  internal  control  attesting  the 
relevance of the model. The results in presence of PHA-treated PBMCs SN incubated for 24 and 72 hours are presented 
in Figure 4B and C, respectively.

As expected, the C10 stimulation alone decreased the TEER compared with the untreated control (Figure 4B and C, 
red histograms vs white  histograms). Similarly,  SN from PBMCs activated  with PHA, also  led to a  decrease in TEER 
compared with the untreated HCoEpiC cells (Figure 4B and C, orange histograms vs white histograms), thus confirming 
here the relevance of these SN as a pro-inflammatory stimulus.

Interestingly,  c-MIM-1  protected  the  epithelial  cells  against  the  PHA-stimulated  PBMCs  SN-induced  disruption 
(Figure  4B,  pink  histogram  vs  yellow  histogram),  after  24  hours.  Regarding  the  TEER  results  obtained  at  72  hours, 
c-MIM-1  effects  appear  to  be  transient,  as  these  protective  effects,  almost  disappeared  (Figure  4C  pink  histogram  vs 
yellow  histogram).  The  results  derived  from  three  independent  experiments  provide  for  the  first  time,  indications  of 
a potential effect of the c-MIM-1 formulation towards the protection of the epithelial barrier in an inflammatory context 
in vitro.

The  effect  of  c-MIM-1  was  assessed  in  human  HCoEpiC  cells  in  absence  of  inflammation,  too.  As  shown  in 
Supplementary  Figure  S1,  c-MIM-1  does  not  alter  the  barrier  permeability  compared  to  the  control  (Ct),  rather  it 
seems  that  c-MIM-1  has  restored  the  resistance  and  has  strengthened  the  epithelial  barrier  at  24  hours  in  comparison 
with the Veh., which has induced a small TEER decrease.

c-MIM-1 Slightly Increased Claudin-1 Expression in a Cellular Model of Intestinal 
Inflammation
In  light  of  the  previous  encouraging  results,  we  wanted  to  investigate  if  the  tested  medicine  could  modulate  the 
expression  of  one  of  the  proteins  present  within  the  tight  junctions,  involved  in  the  regulation  of  the  epithelial  barrier 
permeability. Indeed, claudin-1 is widely expressed in the intestinal epithelium and plays an important role in maintain-
ing intestinal barrier integrity.35  Briefly, HCoEpiC cells were treated with either the Veh. or c-MIM-1 for 24 hours, and 
SN from PHA-treated PBMCs were then added for an additional 30 minutes incubation. The cells were then harvested

Figure  4  C-MIM-1  displays  a  protective  effect  against  intestinal  permeability  in  a  model  of  intestinal  cells  inflamed  with  phytohemagglutinin  (PHA)-stimulated  PBMCs 
supernatants (SN). (A) Representative scheme of the experimental protocol. In the upper panel, the production of the PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) supernatants (SN) is illustrated. The lower panel shows the evaluation of the effect of c-MIM-1 on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in a model of 
HCoEpiC cells. FCS, fetal calf serum; HBSS, Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Briefly, PBMCs from healthy adult volunteers’ donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density 
gradients and the cells were seeded in 24-well round-bottom plates and stimulated with PHA (5 µg/mL) for 48 hours. At the end of the incubation period, the SN containing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines were harvested. In parallel, HCoEpiC cells were grown in 24-well plate inserts until tight confluence. Cells were either not treated (Ct), treated 
with Veh. or treated with c-MIM-1 for 30 min before media replacement with either regular DMEM media or PHA-stimulated PBMCs SN during the next 24 hours or 72 
hours. 30 minutes before the TEER measurement, the media was replaced with HBSS without phenol red alone in the basolateral area, in the apical chamber. Each condition 
has been measured in 3 individual wells (n = 3) and a condition in which C10 alone was incubated was used as a positive control for the induction of the epithelial disruption. 
(B and C) Effect of c-MIM-1 on HCoEpiC TEER after 24 or 72 hours of stimulation with PHA-induced PBMCs SN. Raw data were provided as the measures of the Ω/cm² for 
each  triplicate,  and  were  then  expressed  as  percentages  of  the  control  conditions,  set  as  100%.  Each  histogram  illustrating  the  mean  ±  SD  obtained  for each  assessed

and  mRNA  and  protein  samples  were  extracted  for  claudin-1  expression  analysis.  The  results  of  the  RT-qPCR  are 
presented  in  Figure  5A  and  the  results  from  the  Western  Blots  are  illustrated  in  Figure  5B.  Overall,  in  inflammatory 
conditions, the Veh. did not modulate the claudin-1 expression at the mRNA level, compared with the SN from the PHA- 
treated PBMCs condition. However, when the cells were treated with c-MIM-1, a slight increase (of about 20%) in the 
claudin-1  expression  was  observed.  In  addition,  according  to  the  Western  Blot  quantization,  this  trend  tended  to  be 
confirmed at the protein level, in a similar range of increase. Such results were also observed without any inflammatory

Figure 5 C-MIM-1 slightly increases the expression of claudin-1 in a cellular model of intestinal inflammation. (A) The expression of claudin-1 was assessed by RT-qPCR in 
the HCoEpiC cells, after 24 hours of treatment with either the Veh. or c-MIM-1 and stimulation with the supernatant (SN) from PBMCs treated with PHA (5µg/mL) for 30 
min. The claudin-1 expression has been normalized by the one of the housekeeping gene GAPDH, and the control conditions, without any treatment, have been set at 1. The 
experiment has been done once; each condition was performed in triplicate. (B) The relative expression of claudin-1 at protein level has been assessed by Western Blot in 
the same cellular conditions as above. The expression of β-actin has been used as a housekeeping gene for the protein expression. The claudin-1/β-actin ratios are presented 
in PHA-stimulated PBMCs SN conditions, respectively, after quantization of the Blot’s pictures, using the online ImageJ software (downloaded on the 2nd of May 2022). The 
Western Blots were run twice and the mean ratios ± SD obtained from each Blot are shown. The black dotted lines highlight the effect of c-MIM-1 compared with Veh.

c-MIM-2 Displays Anti-Inflammatory Effects in Human Primary Monocytes Exposed to 
Lipopolysaccharide
The role of TNF-α as a mediator of chronic inflammation,36 as well as the capacity of PGE2 in exacerbating the severity 
of  the  inflammatory-mediated  diseases,16  both  attest  to  the  necessity  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  effect  of  these 
factors when included in MI formulation at ULD. Interestingly, c-MIM-2 rightly contains PGE2 at the inhibitory dose of 
200 K, altogether with TNF-α and IL-1β at 17 CH, IL-6 at 9 CH, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at 4 CH. In 
order to assess the ability of c-MIM-2 to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, and in particular, in reducing the secretion of 
TNF-α and PGE2, a cellular model of human primary monocytes inflamed with LPS was chosen. One of the reasons for 
this model’s  selection  relies  on the  fact that  monocytes exposed  to LPS  produce  high  levels  of  TNF-α,37  and  PGE2,38 
making them a suitable model to test the capacity of c-MIM-2 to down-regulate their expression.

The followed protocol is illustrated in Figure 6A but, briefly, the cells were isolated from three different donors and 
then incubated with either Veh. or c-MIM-2. The inflammatory stimulus was delivered to the cells in the form of a 10 ng/ 
mL  LPS  threat,  30  minutes  after  the  initiation  of  the  treatment.  The  treatments  were  applied  for  24  hours  and  the 
secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and PGE2 was evaluated within the SN by ELISA assay. The results are 
presented  in  Figure  6B–E  either  as  a  percentage  of  the  cytokine  secretion  in  the  untreated  Ct  (-)  condition,  or  as 
a percentage of the cytokine secretion in the Veh. condition, these latter being set as 100% for each tested cytokine. As 
expected, LPS stimulation led to a drastic increase in TNF-α secretion compared with the untreated negative control Ct 
(-) (Figure 6B), thus validating our model selection. In these inflammatory conditions, c-MIM-2 led to a reduction in the 
TNF-α secretion of about 20% (Figure 6C) compared with the Veh. In the same manner, after LPS stimulation, which led 
to a high increase in the basal secretion of PGE2, c-MIM-2 induced a decrease in the secretion of PGE2 of about 30% 
(Figure  6D).  Finally,  as  c-MIM-2  contains  IL-1β  at  17  CH  and  IL-10  at  4  CH,  the  secretion  levels  of  these  two  other 
cytokines  were  also appraised  in  the  same  conditions.  However,  while  c-MIM-2  did  not  affect  IL-1β,  the  IL-10  levels 
were below the ELISA’s detection limit in all tested conditions (data not shown)
