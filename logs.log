Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and is regarded as an important mechanism in disease pathogenesis. One of the key pathogenetic 
mechanisms  of  IR  progression  is  impaired  free  fatty  acid  (FFA)  metabolism.  Plasminogen-
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and key inflammation markers, ie, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP), also play a role.
Purpose: To assess the changing levels of the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, 
CRP and PAI-1 and their association with the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
in myocardial infarction (MI) patients during their hospital stay.
Methods: The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included 95 nondiabetic MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 40 diabetic MI patients. The control group consisted of 30 sex- 
and age-matched volunteers. Serum IL-6 and CRP levels as well as FFA, glucose, C-peptide, 
insulin, and plasma PAI-1 concentrations were measured at days 1 and 12 from MI onset.
Results: At day 1, there was an increase in glucose concentrations, which remained high in both 
groups by day 12 but was much higher in the diabetic patients. Basal insulin and C-peptide levels 
did not differ significantly from those in the control group. The quantitative insulin sensitivity-
check index in both groups was significantly different from that in controls. FFA concentrations 
at day 1 in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients increased; by day 12, they had decreased but 
were still higher than the controls. CRP and IL-6 levels at day 1 were higher in all the patients, 
but diabetic patients had the highest levels; by day 12, the levels were lower but still 2.4-fold 
(IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than those in the control group.
Conclusion: This  study  showed  that  MI  is  accompanied  both  by  activated  inflammatory 
response and IR. Strong correlations between IL-6 and FFA concentrations demonstrate that 
nonspecific inflammation factors are involved in IR development in MI patients. Consequently, 
these inflammatory cytokines might cause the development of IR.
Keywords: insulin resistance, myocardial infarction, inflammation, type 2 diabetes mellitus

Introduction
Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes mel-
litus (T2DM), and is traditionally regarded as an important stage of its pathogenesis: 
IR in general and diabetic populations is associated with cardiovascular risk factors 
including hyperglycemia, dyslipoproteinemia, arterial hypertension, obesity, throm-
bosis, and smoking.1,2

Large clinical trials showed that IR was a predictor of such cardiovascular events 
as ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI).3,4 Additionally, it was estab-
lished that the course of MI as a separate disease is accompanied by IR development

and that the pathogenetic mechanisms are unclear. Medical 
literature has, among others, the following possible reasons 
for IR development: activation of local inflammation in the 
area of atherosclerotic lesion and infarct site with enhanced 
expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and acute-
phase proteins, including C-reactive protein (CRP), as their 
key  representative.5 An  important  role  of  increased  CRP 
levels not only as an MI predictor and a marker of adverse 
outcome  but  also  as  a  precursor  of  IR  development  was 
established earlier.6 High CRP levels are thought to result 
in a change in insulin-action regulation at the cellular level, 
which could lead to IR.7

Among  proinflammatory  cytokines  contributing  to 
IR  development,  the  role  of  interleukin  (IL)-6,  which  has 
autocrine and paracrine properties and is involved in insulin 
reception and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism regulation, 
has been extensively studied. The increase in FFA concen-
trations in myocardial ischemia could also lead to a reduced 
sensitivity to insulin in the peripheral tissues.8,9 Moreover, 
previous experimental studies demonstrated that IL-6 could 
induce plasminogen-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 production. 
Its  activity  increase  is  regarded  both  as  a  risk  factor  for 
coronary atherothrombosis and MI and as a trigger for IR 
 development.10 PAI-1 is known to modulate insulin signal-
ing  in  fibroblasts,  preventing  vitronectin  binding  to  αvβ3-
receptors, which in turn decreases insulin-induced protein 
kinase B phosphorylation.11

According  to  Juhan-Vague  et  al,  obese  patients  with 
hyperinsulinemia  and  a  genotype  associated  with  the 
increased PAI-1 transcription had a high risk of MI.12 Thus, 
an analysis of the medical literature allows the suggestion that 
proinflammatory factors could be involved in IR development 
in acute coronary events. The detection of a possible associa-
tion between metabolic changes, indicators, and nonspecific 
inflammation markers in MI patients, including those with 
T2DM, can play a role in the choice of treatment strategy in 
terms of risk stratification in this category of patients.

This study was aimed at assessing the changing levels of 
the metabolic proinflammation IR markers IL-6, CRP and 
PAI-1,  and  their  association  with  presence  or  absence  of 
T2DM in MI patients during their hospital stay.

Materials and methods
Study subjects and design
A total of 155 MI patients (95 males and 60 females), mean 
age 65 ± 4.5 years, and 30 sex- and age-matched volunteers 
(the control group) with no cardiovascular or endocrine dis-
eases were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided 

into  two  groups:  group  I  comprised  95  nondiabetic  MI 
patients, and group 2 enrolled 60 diabetic MI patients. The 
mean T2DM duration was, on average, 6.4 ± 1.5 years. The 
groups were sex- and age-matched and had similar risk fac-
tors for ischemic heart disease, concurrent conditions, and 
MI complication rate.

The main demographic characteristics of the study patients 
are summarized in Table 1. The patient groups were similar in 
age, sex, main risk factors of ischemic heart disease, comor-
bidities, and coronary event incidence (Table 1). The study 
excluded patients older than 75 years and/or with clinically 
significant concurrent conditions (autoimmune diseases, thy-
roid gland, or adrenal gland diseases). However, there were 
more obese patients among those with T2DM compared to 
nondiabetic patients, according to body mass index (BMI) lev-
els: 29.65 (26.85–34.55) kg/m2 vs 25.5 (23.2–30.1) kg/m2.

Acute MI was diagnosed according to the 2007 Russian 
National  Cardiology  Society  guidelines  based  on  clinical, 
electrocardiographic,  echocardiographic,  and  biochemical 
signs of the disease. The inclusion criteria were chest pain 
refractory to nitroglycerin, myocardial ischemia, and necro-
sis  signs  (ST-segment  elevation  and/or  new  pathologic  Q 
waves on the electrocardiogram, elevated cardiac enzymes: 
MB fraction of creatine kinase [CK MB] and troponin T).

Insulin resistance and inflammation markers in MI

Peak CK MB and troponin T levels did not differ between 
the groups. Peak CK MB levels were 94.03 ± 17.9 U/L and 
137.64 ± 41.1 U/L in the diabetic and nondiabetic patients, 
respectively  (P  =  0.916);  troponin T  concentrations  were 
1.09 ± 0.92 ng/mL and 0.71 ± 0.41 ng/mL in the diabetic 
and nondiabetic patients, respectively (P = 0.564).

The  exclusion  criteria  were  age  .75  years,  clinically 
significant comorbidities (autoimmune diseases, thyroid or 
adrenal gland diseases), acute coronary syndrome as a com-
plication of percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary 
artery bypass surgery.

The patient groups had a similar incidence of major hos-
pital coronary events (Table 1). Eighty percent of patients 
in both groups did not have any signs of acute heart failure, 
according to the Killip classification (1967) upon admission 
and during the hospital stay (Table 1); however, more than 
50% of patients had arrhythmias and impaired conduction 
diagnosed according to the established criteria.13 The struc-
ture and function of the left ventricle did not differ between 
the  groups.  Mean  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  was 
51.25% ± 1.85% in the diabetic patients and 50.42% ± 1.62% 
in those without T2DM (P = 0.598); mean left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume was 164.35 ± 10.47 mL in the diabetic 
patients and 156.43 ± 7.18 mL in the nondiabetic patients 
(P = 0.649); mean left ventricular end-systolic volume was 
79.71 ± 8.32 mL in the diabetic patients and 75.22 ± 5.56 in 
the nondiabetic patients (P = 0.702).

The groups were similar in the presence/type of coronary 
artery  disease:  coronary  angiography  showed  multivessel 
(more  than  three  vessels)  hemodynamically  significant 
coronary artery lesions in both groups (76.5% in the diabetic 
patients and 62.5% in the nondiabetic patients [P = 0.857]). 
T2DM  compensation  was  evaluated  based  on  glycated 
hemoglobin  levels  (T2DM  was  considered  to  be  compen-
sated in glycated hemoglobin .7.5%, according to the 2000 
European Diabetes Policy Group criteria). Decompensated 
T2DM was diagnosed in eight (40%) patients.

The  study  design  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review Board of the Research Institute for Complex Issues 
of  Cardiovascular  Diseases;  all  the  individuals  signed  the 
informed consent before being enrolled in the study. Thera-
peutic interventions during the follow-up period are listed 
in Table 2.

Assays
Serum IL-6 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay at days 1 and 12 from the MI onset 
using Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) test-systems.

CRP,  serum  FFA,  and  glucose  concentrations  were  mea-
sured at the same study time points using standard Thermo 
Fisher Scientific (Vantaa, Finland) test systems on a Konelab 
30i  biochemistry  analyzer  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific  Oy, 
Vantaa, Finland). C-peptide and insulin concentrations were 
measured  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  with 
BioMedica (Waterloo, NSW, Australia) and Diagnostic Sys-
tems Laboratories (Webster, TX, USA) lab kits, respectively. 
Plasma  PAI-1  concentrations  were  assessed  with  standard 
Technoclone  (Vienna, Austria)  test  systems. Additionally, 
all the patients had their postprandial glycemia, insulin, and 
C-peptide concentrations measured 2 hours after a standard 
carbohydrate breakfast (75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved 
in 250–300 mL water to drink for 3–5 minutes on an empty 
stomach).

The IR level was estimated using a structural mathemati-
cal model incorporating fasting serum insulin and glucose 
measurement with the quantitative insulin sensitivity-check 
index (QUICKI) calculation. QUICKI  = 1/(log [I0] + log 
[G0]),  where  I0  –  basal  insulinemia  (mg/dL),  G0  –  basal 
glycemia  (mME/mL). According  to  Katz  et  al,  a  mean 
QUICKI  value  of  0.382  ±  0.007  correlates  with  normal 
tissue  sensitivity  to  insulin,  while  QUICKI  values  of 
0.331 ± 0.010 and 0.304 ± 0.007 correlate with moderate 
and severe IR.14

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney  test  for  unpaired  samples  and  the Wilcoxon  test 
for  paired  samples. The  results  were  presented  as  median 
and quartiles. P-values , 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated 
to analyze the correlations between the variables. The statis-
tical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0 (StatSoft, 
Tulsa, OK, USA).

Results
The  diabetic  and  nondiabetic  MI  patients  were  found  to 
have a 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold increase (respectively) in blood 
glucose  levels  at  day  1  compared  to  those  in  the  control 
group  (Table  3). The  increase  in  basal  glucose  levels  was 
still present at day 12 in both patient groups, but was more 
pronounced  in  the  diabetic  patients.  Postprandial  glucose 
concentrations were 2.6-fold increased in the individuals with 
MI and T2DM at day 12, while in the nondiabetic patients 
postprandial glucose levels decreased compared to the basal 
levels but did not reach those in the controls.

Unlike glucose concentrations, fasting serum insulin and 
C-peptide levels had a tendency towards increasing in both 
groups at days 1 and 12 after MI onset, but did not differ from 
those in the controls (Table 3). The change in postprandial 
levels of those parameters at day 12 was more significant. 
Indeed,  postprandial  insulin  concentrations  both  in  the 
diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients crept up in an almost 
similar way compared to the control and basal levels.

Despite the fact that the changes in glucose metabolism 
were less pronounced in the nondiabetic MI patients, the inte-
gral QUICKI of IR in both groups significantly differed from 
that in the controls. In the controls, the QUICKI value was 
0.38 ± 0.01 and corresponded to the normal tissue sensitiv-
ity to insulin. In the group of nondiabetic patients, QUICKI 
values were 0.316 ± 0.005 and 0.319 ± 0.005 at days 1 and 
12, respectively, which were regarded as borderline values 
between  severe  and  moderate  IR.  In  diabetic  MI  patients, 
QUICKI values were 0.296 ± 0.009 and 0.300 ± 0.005, which 
according to Katz et al corresponded to severe IR.14

Analysis of FFA concentration changes in MI patients 
showed significant differences compared to the controls both 
at day 1 and at day 12 of the disease (Table 4). At day 1, FFA 
concentrations in both diabetic and nondiabetic MI patients 
were seven- and elevenfold higher than those in the controls, 
respectively. By day 12, the levels had decreased, but were 
still three- and 4.7-fold higher than those in the controls; thus, 
in patients with such comorbidity, these changes were more 
pronounced during the entire follow-up period.

PAI-1 concentrations were found to be increased in both 
groups, but at the same time at day 1 the diabetic MI patients 
had  a  4.6-fold  increase  in  PAI-1  levels  compared  to  the 
 controls (Table 4). These values were, on average, twofold 
higher than those in the nondiabetic patients. At day 12 from 
MI onset, PAI-1 concentrations significantly decreased in both 
groups; however, they did not reach the control levels.

Measurement of the key inflammation markers showed 
that  at  day  1,  the  whole  study  population  had  3.6-  and

19-fold increased IL-6 and CRP concentrations, respectively 
(Table 5). At the same time, the diabetic patients had more 
pronounced changes in the levels of inflammation markers: 
IL-6  and  CRP  concentrations  were  5.3-fold  and  26-fold 
higher,  respectively  (Table  3). At  day  12,  IL-6  and  CRP 
concentrations had decreased in both groups, but were still 
on average 2.4-fold (IL-6) and 12.5-fold (CRP) higher than 
those in the controls, the diabetic MI patients having higher 
IL-6 and CRP levels during the entire follow-up period.

Correlation  analysis  demonstrated  the  correlations 
between CRP and FFA concentrations (R = 0.53, P = 0.04 for 
the  nondiabetic patients; R = 0.41, P = 0.03 for the diabetic 
patients) (Figure 1); CRP levels and CK MB activity (R = 0.42, 
P = 0.03 for the nondiabetic patients; R = 0.38, P = 0.027 for 
the diabetic patients). The diabetic MI patients had a positive 
correlation between CRP and PAI-1 concentrations (R = 0.5, 
P = 0.0027) and a negative one with QUICKI (R = –0.33, 
P  =  0.039). A  correlation  between  basal  glucose  and  IL-6 
levels  (R  =  0.48,  P  =  0.031  for  the  nondiabetic  patients;

correlations  between  CRP  and  postprandial  glucose  levels 
were found (R = 0.48, P = 0.045 for the nondiabetic patients; 
R = 0.51, P = 0.041 for the diabetic patients) (Figure 3).

In both groups, there were positive correlations between 
IL-6 and FFA concentrations (R = 0.12, P = 0.01; R = 0.49, 
P  =  0.005),  IL-6  and  PAI-1  concentrations  (R  =  0.47, 
P = 0.04; R = 0.54, P = 0.03) (Figure 4), IL-6 levels and CK

ure 5), and CRP concentrations and IL-6 levels (R = 0.29, 
P = 0.04; R = 0.38, P = 0.03) (Figure 6).

Discussion
According to the contemporary understanding, IR has been 
traditionally regarded as the key stage of T2DM  pathogenesis 
as  well  as  a  risk  factor  for  atherosclerosis  and  MI.15 The 
 well-established  IR  markers  are  glucose,  insulin,  and 
C- peptide  concentrations;  however,  according  to  medical 
literature, postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels are more 
informative than basal (fasting) ones, particularly when there 
are no obvious IR signs.16 This study shows that IR develops 
in MI patients, which is reflected by basal and postprandial 
hyperglycemia both in the acute and early recovery phases irre-
spective of T2DM presence. Indeed, the study demonstrated 
that both diabetic and nondiabetic patients had significantly 
increased glucose levels, while basal insulin concentrations 
did not differ significantly; however, there was a significant 
1.7-fold increase in postprandial insulin levels compared to 
those in the control groups, and the medical literature confirms 
that this parameter is a marker of IR. IR was also confirmed 
by lower QUICKI values. Diabetic MI patients had severe IR, 
and those without T2DM had moderate IR.

Among  other  IR  factors  in  MI,  such  proinflammatory 
cytokines and acute-phase proteins as IL-6 and CRP have been 
extensively studied in the medical literature.3 Recent research 
has shown that IL-6 has autocrine and paracrine properties 
along with its proinflammatory and cardiodepressive effects, 
and might be involved in IR development in MI patients.17 
A large prospective trial in 7735 nondiabetic males with no 
prediabetic conditions, conducted in the UK between 1978 and 
2005, showed a strong association between higher IL-6 levels 
and a risk of T2DM, irrespective of age and obesity.18

Some  authors  suggest  that  molecular  mechanisms 
of  mediated  IL-6  resistance  to  insulin  might  include  the 
 activation of proinflammatory serine/threonine stress kinases, 
protein  suppressors  of  cytokine  signaling,  and  protein 
tyrosine phosphatases acting as physiologic negative regula-
tors of insulin.2

IL-6 was also shown to increase FFA levels in the blood 
of male volunteers, which could induce resistance to periph-
eral tissue insulin. IL-6 is supposed to inhibit the activity of 
lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes, and on the contrary activate 
cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate-dependent  hormone-
 sensitive lipase in hepatocytes, which contributes to impaired 
circulating lipoprotein metabolism and FFA buildup inducing 
insulin-receptor dysfunction and IR development.15,19

The results of this study demonstrate higher IL-6 and FFA 
levels in the acute phase of MI and their further decrease in 
the early recovery period. Additionally, at day 1, the diabetic 
MI patients had the highest IL-6 and FFA concentrations, 
which could have been associated with profound metabolic 
changes  due  to  more  pronounced  IR  in  this  category  of

patients. The increased production of inflammation mediators 
seems to contribute to lipolysis activation accompanied by 
excess FFA release into the blood flow. The observed  positive 
correlation  between  IL-6  and  FFA  levels  confirms  this 
 suggestion. Reaching the liver, FFA on one hand becomes a 
substrate for triglyceride and atherogenic lipoprotein produc-
tion, and on the other hand causes the buildup of other lipid 
metabolites (ceramides, diacylglycerides), inducing impaired 
insulin signaling and thereby contributing to IR development 
to a much greater extent.16

According to reports of other authors, IL-6 is produced 
by different immune-system and adipose-tissue cells, as well 
as  endothelial  and  epithelial  cells.18  Experimental  studies 
showed that in MI, the main source of this cytokine is cardio-
myocytes, activated macrophages, and T-lymphocytes being 
attracted  to  the  ischemic  region  of  necrosis.20   Obviously, 
the increase in IL-6 concentrations demonstrates not only 
higher  cytokine  production  in  the  cells  involved  in  MI

pathogenesis but also reflects the activity of inflammation 
in the affected myocardium. The results of the correlation 
analysis, which showed positive correlations between IL-6 
and cardiospecific markers of myocardial necrosis, support 
this hypothesis.

IL-6 has recently been established to be capable of stimu-
lating PAI-1 in vitro generation in different cells; PAI-1 is not 
only the key component of the fibrinolytic system but also an 
IR marker.11 PAI-1 has recently been found to block insulin 
signaling in adipocytes, and at the same time the exposition 
of  high  insulin-content  adipocytes  was  accompanied  by 
increased PAI-1 concentrations in these cells. In this study, 
we found higher PAI-1 concentrations in both patient groups, 
and T2DM presence determined higher concentrations of this 
marker in the acute MI phase.

Meanwhile,  in  the  early  recovery  phase,  both  patient 
groups had lower PAI-1 concentrations, which demonstrated 
fibrinolytic activity normalization due to the treatment. The 
correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between 
IL-6 and PAI-1 concentrations in MI patients, which con-
firmed the IL-6-inducing impact on the production of this

protein.  Obviously,  in  MI,  excess  PAI-1  not  only  leads  to 
slower  fibrinolysis,  buildup  of  fibrin,  and  its  degradation 
products and thereby to microvascular thromboses but is also 
involved in IR development, which amplifies prothrombotic 
status.3

Along with activated cytokine production, cardiomyocyte 
ischemia and necrosis are accompanied by the production 
of acute-phase proteins, primarily CRP, which is involved 
in the responses aimed at localizing the affected region and 
myocardial remodeling initiation.16 CRP levels are known 
to increase significantly already 6–8 hours after myocardial 
tissue injury, reach their peak within 24–48 hours, and then 
decrease with a circulation half-time of 6 hours.17 This study 
shows higher CRP concentrations in both patient groups in 
the acute and early recovery phases. The presence of T2DM 
determined the highest protein concentrations in MI patients 
during the entire follow-up period, which might be associ-
ated with higher IL-6 concentrations in this patient category. 
Previous research has established IL-6 to be the most signifi-
cant inducer of CRP production. At the same time, experi-
mental studies showed that CRP was capable of inducing 
IR. According to Pravenec et al, transgenic rats expressing 
human CRP in high concentrations had metabolic disorders 
(hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and glycogen-production 
impairment stimulated by insulin in the skeletal muscles), 
which are intrinsic to IR syndrome.21 D’Alessandris et al 
established that CRP induces serine phosphorylation in the 
insulin-receptor  domain,  which  impairs  the  ability  of  the 
latter to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and leads to 
IR development in rat myocytes.22 Meanwhile, we discovered 
positive correlations between CRP levels and the activity 
of CK MB fraction. The observed correlative associations 
between CRP and metabolic IR markers demonstrate that 
IL-6  is  not  only  the  key  inflammation  mediator  but  also 
plays an active role in FFA and glucose metabolism, and 
fibrinolytic system protein production and secretion, which 
can be involved in pathogenetic events associated with IR 
in MI.

Conclusion
The results of this study demonstrate that MI as well as acti-
vated inflammation is accompanied by IR development. The 
most informative indicators of impaired sensitivity to insulin 
in MI are increases in FFA and PAI-1 levels compared to 
postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The observed strong 
associations  between  IL-6,  CRP,  basal  and  postprandial 
glycemia, and insulinemia, as well as FFA and PAI-1 levels 
evidence the involvement of nonspecific inflammation factors

in IR development and the amplification of prothrombogenic 
potential in MI patients.

In turn, the presence of preexisting IR determines higher 
thrombogenic status and increases the risk of not only pri-
mary but also recurrent cardiovascular events. The observed 
consistent patterns can lead to new treatment strategies to 
prevent T2DM in MI patients and improve quality of life.

ABSTRACT

Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system that can be triggered 
by a variety of factors, including pathogens, damaged cells and toxic compounds. 
These  factors  may  induce  acute  and/or  chronic  inflammatory  responses  in  the 
heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, intestinal tract and reproductive system, 
potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. Both infectious and non-infectious 
agents and cell damage activate inflammatory cells and trigger inflammatory signaling 
pathways, most commonly the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. Here, we review 
inflammatory responses within organs, focusing on the etiology of inflammation, 
inflammatory response mechanisms, resolution of inflammation, and organ-specific 
inflammatory responses.

INTRODUCTION

Inflammation is the immune system’s response to 
harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic 
compounds,  or  irradiation  [1],  and  acts  by  removing 
injurious  stimuli  and  initiating  the  healing  process  [2]. 
Inflammation  is  therefore  a  defense  mechanism  that  is 
vital  to  health  [3].  Usually,  during  acute  inflammatory 
responses, cellular and molecular events and interactions 
efficiently minimize impending injury or infection. This 
mitigation  process  contributes  to  restoration  of  tissue 
homeostasis  and  resolution  of  the  acute  inflammation. 
However, uncontrolled acute inflammation may become 
chronic, contributing to a variety of chronic inflammatory 
diseases [4].

At  the  tissue  level,  inflammation  is  characterized 
by  redness,  swelling,  heat,  pain,  and  loss  of  tissue 
function, which result from local immune, vascular and 
inflammatory  cell  responses  to  infection  or  injury  [5]. 
Important microcirculatory events that occur during the 
inflammatory  process  include  vascular  permeability 
changes,  leukocyte  recruitment  and  accumulation,  and 
inflammatory mediator release [2, 6].

Various pathogenic factors, such as infection, tissue 
injury, or cardiac infarction, can induce inflammation by 
causing  tissue  damage.  The  etiologies  of  inflammation 
can be infectious or non-infectious (Table 1). In response 
to  tissue  injury,  the  body  initiates  a  chemical  signaling 
cascade that stimulates responses aimed at healing affected 
tissues. These signals activate leukocyte chemotaxis from 
the general circulation to sites of damage. These activated 
leukocytes produce cytokines that induce inflammatory 
responses [7].

share a common mechanism, which can be summarized 
as  follows:  1)  cell  surface  pattern  receptors  recognize 
detrimental  stimuli;  2)  inflammatory  pathways  are 
activated; 3) inflammatory markers are released; and 4) 
inflammatory cells are recruited.

Pattern recognition receptor activation

Microbial structures known as pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) can trigger the inflammatory 
response 
through  activation  of  germline-encoded 
pattern-recognition  receptors  (PRRs)  expressed  in  both 
immune  and  nonimmune  cells  [10,  11].  Some  PRRs 
also  recognize  various  endogenous  signals  activated 
during tissue or cell damage and are known as danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) [11]. DAMPs are 
host biomolecules that can initiate and perpetuate a non-
infectious inflammatory response [12]. Disrupted cells can 
also recruit innate inflammatory cells in the absence of 
pathogens by releasing DAMPs [13]. 

Classes  of  PRR  families  include  the  Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), retinoic 
acid-inducible  gene  (RIG)-I-like  receptors  (RLRs),  and 
NOD-like  receptors  (NLRs)  [5].  TLRs  are  a  family  of 
highly  conserved,  mammalian  PRRs  that  participate  in 
the activation of the inflammatory response [14]. More 
than ten members of the TLR family have been identified, 
and TLRs are the most well-studied of the known PRRs 
[15]. Transmission of PAMPs and DAMPs is mediated 
by myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) along with 
TLRs. Signaling through TLRs activates an intracellular 
signaling  cascade  [16,  17]  that  leads  to  nuclear 
translocation  of  transcription  factors,  such  as  activator 
protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB or interferon regulatory factor 
3 (IRF3) (Figure 1). DAMPs and PAMPs share receptors, 
such as TLR4, suggesting similarities between infectious 
and noninfectious inflammatory responses [18, 19].

Activation of inflammatory pathways

Inflammatory  pathways  impact  the  pathogenesis 
of  a  number  of  chronic  diseases,  and  involve  common 
inflammatory  mediators  and  regulatory  pathways. 
Inflammatory  stimuli  activate  intracellular  signaling 
pathways that then activate production of inflammatory 

mediators.  Primary  inflammatory  stimuli,  including 
microbial products and cytokines such as interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), mediate inflammation through interaction with 
the TLRs, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), 
and the TNF receptor (TNFR) [20]. Receptor activation 
triggers  important  intracellular  signaling  pathways, 
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and Janus kinase (JAK)-
signal  transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT) 
pathways [21–23].

NF-κB pathway

The  NF-κB  transcription  factor  plays  important 
roles  in  inflammatory,  immune  response,  survival,  and 
apoptosis  processes  [24].  The  NF-κB  family  includes 
five related transcription factors: P50, p52, RelA (p65), 
RelB, and c-Rel [25, 26]. NF-κB activity is induced by a 
range of stimuli, including pathogen-derived substances, 
intercellular inflammatory cytokines, and many enzymes 
[27,  28].  Under  physiological  conditions,  IκB  proteins 
present in the cytoplasm inhibit NF-κB [29]. PRRs use 
similar  signal  transduction  mechanisms  to  activate  IκB 
kinase (IKK), which is composed of two kinase subunits, 
IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, such as IKKγ. 
IKK  regulates  NF-κB  pathway  activation  through  IκB 
phosphorylation  [8].  IκB  phosphorylation  results  in  its 
degradation by the proteasome and the subsequent release 
of NF-κB for nuclear translocation and gene transcription 
activation [30]. This pathway regulates pro-inflammatory 
cytokine production and inflammatory cell recruitment, 
which contribute to the inflammatory response (Figure 2).

MAPK pathway

MAPKs  are  a  family  of  serine/threonine  protein 
kinases  that  direct  cellular  responses  to  a  variety  of 
stimuli,  including  osmotic  stress,  mitogens,  heat  shock, 
and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-
6),  which  regulate  cell  proliferation,  differentiation,  cell 
survival and apoptosis [31, 32]. The mammalian MAPKs 
include  extracellular-signal-regulated  kinase  ERK1/2, 
p38  MAP  Kinase,  and  c-Jun  N-terminal  kinases  (JNK) 
[33].  Each  MAPK  signaling  pathway  comprises  at  least 

7205

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetthree components: a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), 
and  a  MAPK  kinase  kinase  (MAPKKK).  MAPKKKs 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn 
phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs  [33,  34].  ERKs  are 
generally activated by mitogens and differentiation signals, 

while  inflammatory  stimuli  and  stress  activate  JNK  and 
p38 [35]. MKK1 and MKK2 activate ERK1/2, MKK4 and 
MKK7 activate JNK, and MKK3 and MKK6 activate p38. 
Activation of the MAPKs, including Erk1/2, JNK, leads to 
phosphorylation and activation of p38 transcription factorsv  

Figure 1: TLR signaling. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways are shown. Signaling through TLRs activates intracellular 
signaling cascades that lead to nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB or IRF3, which regulates the inflammatory response.

Figure 2: NF-κB pathway. This pathway is triggered by TLRs and inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, leading to activation 
of  RelA/p50  complexes  that  regulate  expression  of  inflammatory  cytokines.  NF-κB  signaling  requires  IKK  subunits.  which  regulate 
pathway activation through IκB phosphorylation.

7206

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetpresent  in  the  cytoplasm  or  nucleus,  which  initiates  the 
inflammatory response [32, 36] (Figure 3).

JAK-STAT pathway

The  highly  conserved  JAK-STAT  pathway  involves 
diverse  cytokines,  growth  factors,  interferons,  and  related 
molecules,  such  as  leptin  and  growth  hormone,  and  is  a 
signaling mechanism through which extracellular factors can 
control  gene  expression  [37].  Receptor-associated  JAKs  are 
activated  by  ligands  and  phosphorylate  one  other,  creating 
docking  sites  for  STATs,  which  are  latent,  cytoplasmic 
transcription factors. Cytoplasmic STATs recruited to these sites 
undergo phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization before 
translocation  to  the  nucleus  [38].  Tyrosine  phosphorylation 
is  essential  for  STAT  dimerization  and  DNA  binding  [39]. 
Therefore, JAK/STAT signaling allows for the direct translation 
of an extracellular signal into a transcriptional response. For 
example, binding of IL-6 family members to plasma membrane 
receptors  activates  the  JAK-STAT  proteins.  STAT  proteins 
translocated into the nucleus bind target gene promoter regions 
to regulate transcription of inflammatory genes (Figure 4) [40].

Dysregulation  of  NF-κB,  MAPK,  or  JAK-STAT 
activity  is  associated  with  inflammatory,  autoimmune, 
and metabolic diseases, and cancer [41]. Signaling through 
transcription factors results in secretion of cytokines [42, 
43].  Multiple  transcription  factors  regulate  a  variety  of 
inflammatory  genes,  such  as  IL-1,  TNF-α,  IL-6  [44], 
colony stimulating factor (CSF), interferons, transforming 
growth factor (TGF), and chemokines.

Inflammatory markers

Markers are used in clinical applications to indicate 
normal versus pathogenic biological processes, and assess 
responses  to  therapeutic  interventions.  Inflammatory 
markers  may  be  predictive  of  inflammatory  diseases 
[45–50], and correlate with the causes and consequences 
of various inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular 
diseases, endothelial dysfunctions, and infection [51, 52]. 
Stimuli activate inflammatory cells, such as macrophages 
and adipocytes, and induce production of inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and inflammatory 
proteins  and  enzymes. These  molecules  can  potentially 
serve as biomarkers for diseases diagnosis, prognosis, and 
therapeutic decision making [53–57].

Inflammatory cytokines

Cytokines  (Table  2)  are  predominantly  released 
from immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, 
and lymphocytes. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines 
respectively. 
facilitate  and 
Inflammatory  cytokines  are  classified  as  ILs,  colony 
stimulating  factors  (CSF),  IFNs,  TNFs,  TGFs,  and 
chemokines,  and  are  produced  by  cells  primarily  to 

inflammation, 

inhibit 

recruit leukocytes to the site of infection or injury [58]. 
Cytokines  modulate  the  immune  response  to  infection 
or  inflammation  and  regulate  inflammation  itself  via  a 
complex  network  of  interactions.  However,  excessive 
inflammatory  cytokine  production  can  lead  to  tissue 
damage,  hemodynamic  changes,  organ  failure,  and 
ultimately death [59, 60]. A better understanding of how to 
regulate cytokine pathways would allow for more accurate 
identification  of  agent-mediated  inflammation  and  the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases [58].

Inflammatory proteins and enzymes

Inflammatory  proteins  in  the  blood,  including 
C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  haptoglobin,  serum  amyloid 
A,  fibrinogen,  and  alpha  1-acid  glycoprotein  [61], 
help  restore  homeostasis  and  reduce  microbial  growth 
independently  of  antibodies  during  trauma,  stress,  or 
infection [62]. Abnormal activation of certain enzymes, 
including  high-mobility  group  box  1  (HMGB1), 
superoxide  dismutase  (SOD),  glutathione  peroxidase 
(GPx),  NADPH  oxidase  (NOX),  inducible  nitric  oxide 
synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, play key 
roles in the development of inflammation-related diseases, 
such as cardiovascular disease and cancer [63–66]. For 
example, extracellular HMGB1 effects may be mediated 
by  activation  of TLR-coupled  signaling  pathways  [67]. 
The primary target of extracellular HMGB1 is TLR4 [68], 
which triggers MyD88-dependent intracellular signaling 
cascades involved in activation of the NF-κB and MAPK 
pathways.  This  leads  to  release  of  such  inflammatory 
cytokines as TNF-α and IL-1β [67]. Inflammatory proteins 
and enzymes have been used as inflammation, infection, 
and trauma biomarkers in medicine.

Other inflammatory markers

(MDA), 

Antioxidant defense systems, including antioxidant 
enzymes, influence oxidative stress. Elevated oxidative 
stress can induce production of reactive oxygen species 
8-Hydroxy-2-
(ROS),  malondialdehyde 
deoxyguanosine  (8-OHdG)  and  isoprostanes  [64,  69], 
each of which can activate various transcription factors, 
including NF-κB, AP-1, p53, and STAT. Thus, this cascade 
can increase expression of genes encoding growth factors, 
inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [70]. Oxidative 
stress  is  associated  with  the  pathogenesis  of  multiple 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, 
hypertension,  aging,  and  atherosclerosis.  Therefore, 
oxidative stress products can also be used as markers of 
the inflammatory response.

macrophages, monocytes, and other cells mediate local 
responses  to  tissue  damage  and  infection.  At  sites  of 
tissue  injury,  damaged  epithelial  and  endothelial  cells 
release  factors  that  trigger  the  inflammatory  cascade, 
along with chemokines and growth factors, which attract 
neutrophils and monocytes. The first cells attracted to a 
site  of  injury  are  neutrophils,  followed  by  monocytes, 
lymphocytes (natural killer cells [NK cells], T cells, and B 
cells), and mast cells [71–73]. Monocytes can differentiate 
into macrophages and dendritic cells and are recruited via 

7208

chemotaxis into damaged tissues. Inflammation-mediated 
immune  cell  alterations  are  associated  with  many 
diseases, including asthma, cancer, chronic inflammatory 
diseases, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and autoimmune and 
degenerative diseases.

Neutrophils,  which 

target  microorganisms 

in 
the  body,  can  also  damage  host  cells  and  tissues  [74]. 
Neutrophils  are  key  mediators  of  the  inflammatory 
response, and program antigen presenting cells to activate T 
cells and release localized factors to attract monocytes and 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotargetdendritic cells [7]. Macrophages are important components 
of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and are critical in 
inflammation initiation, maintenance, and resolution [75]. 
During  inflammation,  macrophages  present  antigens, 
undergo phagocytosis, and modulate the immune response 
by  producing  cytokines  and  growth  factors.  Mast  cells, 
which reside in connective tissue matrices and on epithelial 
surfaces,  are  effector  cells  that  initiate  inflammatory 
responses.  Activated  mast  cell  release  a  variety  of 
inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, 
histamine,  proteases,  prostaglandins,  leukotrienes,  and 
serglycin proteoglycans [76].

Multiple  groups  have  demonstrated  that  platelets 
impact  inflammatory  processes,  from  atherosclerosis 
to  infection.  Platelet  interactions  with  inflammatory 
cells  may  mediate  pro-inflammatory  outcomes.  The 
acute  phase  response  (APR)  is  the  earliest  response  to 
infection or injury, and some studies have indicated that 
platelets induce the APR [77]. After being recruited by 
inflammatory stimuli, immune cells amplify and sustain 
the APR by releasing local inflammatory mediators at the 
site of recruitment.

RESOLUTION OF INFLAMMATION

To  prevent  progression  from  acute  inflammation  to 
persistent,  chronic  inflammation,  the  inflammatory  response 
must  be  suppressed  to  prevent  additional  tissue  damage. 
Inflammation resolution is a well-managed process involving 
the spatially- and temporally-controlled production of mediators, 
during  which  chemokine  gradients  are  diluted  over  time. 

Circulating white blood cells eventually no longer sense these 
gradients and are not recruited to sites of injury. Dysregulation of 
this process can lead to uncontrolled chronic inflammation [78]. 
Inflammation resolution processes that rectify tissue homeostasis 
include reduction or cessation of tissue infiltration by neutrophils 
and  apoptosis  of  spent  neutrophils,  counter-regulation  of 
chemokines and cytokines, macrophage transformation from 
classically  to  alternatively  activated  cells,  and  initiation  of 
healing [79, 80].
Chronic 

inflammation  occurs  when 
to  eliminate 

acute 
inflammatory  mechanisms  fail 
tissue 
injury [81], and may lead to a host of diseases, such as 
cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers [82]. Understanding the 
common mechanisms that orchestrate dysfunction in the 
various  organ  systems  will  allow  for  development  and 
production of improved targeted therapies.

ORGAN-SPECIFIC 
RESPONSES

INFLAMMATORY 

Inflammation  has  long  been  recognized  as  a 
major  cause  of  disease.  It  is  estimated  that  some  15% 
of human cancers are associated with chronic infection 
and inflammation [83]. Acute and chronic inflammation-
mediated tissue injury is observed in many organ systems, 
including the heart, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, brain, 
intestinal tract, and reproductive system.

Figure 3: MAPK pathway. This pathway mediates intracellular signaling initiated by extracellular stimuli, such as stress and cytokines. 
MAPKKKs  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKKs,  which  in  turn  phosphorylate  and  activate  MAPKs.  The  mammalian  MAPK  family 
includes Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. In the Erk1/2 pathway, Erk1/2 is activated by MKK1/2, which is activated by Raf. In the JNK pathway, 
JNK is activated by MKK4/7, which is activated by MEKK1/4, ASK1, and MLK3. In the p38 pathway, p38 is activated by MKK3/6, 
which is activated by MLK3, TAK, and DLK. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate various proteins, including transcription factors, resulting 
in regulation of inflammatory responses.

Cardiovascular disease, and its underlying pathology, 
atherosclerosis, is the major cause of death and disability 
worldwide [84, 85]. By 2030, almost 23.6 million people 
are projected to die annually from cardiovascular disorders 
[86,  87].  Inflammatory  mediators  play  key  roles  in 
atherosclerosis, from initial leukocyte recruitment through 
rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque [88–91]. Inflammation 
is also an early event in cardiac stress. Elevated levels of 
endothelial adhesion molecules and increased inflammatory 
cytokine  and  chemokine  production  and  release  are 
observed in affected cardiac tissues [92].

The innate immune system is the primary cardiac 
defense  against  pathogens  and  tissue  damage  [93]. 
Myocardial  infarction,  which  commonly  results  from 
coronary atherosclerosis and involves acute loss of many 
myocardial cells, is the most common cause of cardiac 
injury [94]. Necrotic cardiac cells initiate an inflammatory 
cascade  to  clear  dead  cells  and  debris  from  the  infarct 
[95,  96].  Cell  death  releases  intracellular  components 
that  activate  innate  immune  mechanisms  to  initiate  an 
inflammatory  response.  Endogenous  ligands  released 
following  injury  are  recognized  as  danger  signals  by 
cell  surface  receptors,  and  activate  inflammation  [97, 
98].  TLR-mediated  pathways  trigger  post-infarction 
inflammatory  responses  by  activating  NF-κB  signaling 
[98–103]. Chemokines recruit inflammatory leukocytes to 
the infarct, and cytokines promote leukocyte-endothelial 
cell  adhesions  [104,  105].  Moreover, TGF-β  and  IL-10 
promote  cardiac  repair  by  suppressing  inflammation, 
enhancing  myofibroblast  phenotypic  modulation,  and 
promoting extracellular matrix deposition [106, 107].

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death 
and disability in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially 
those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), in whom cardiovascular 
disease occurs 14.6 years earlier on average [108]. About 
two-thirds  of  deaths  in  people  with  diabetes  are  due  to 

cardiovascular disease; among these, approximately 40% 
die from ischemic heart disease, 15% from other forms 
of heart disease, principally congestive heart failure, and 
about  10%  from  stroke  [109].  Recent  global  estimates 
indicate that over 422 million adults currently live with 
diabetes, of which over 90% have T2D.

Diabetes 

is  a  group  of  metabolic  disorders 
characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels, and is 
a major global health challenge, both to individuals and 
their families, and to healthcare systems [110]. Diabetes 
complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, 
limb amputation, blindness, and nerve damage. Diabetes 
results  from  either  impaired  insulin  production  in  the 
pancreas or body cells not responding to produced insulin 
[111]. Insulin resistance is defined as decreased insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake, and is associated with inactivity, 
obesity, and aging. Pancreatic islet cells respond to insulin 
resistance by enhancing insulin secretion and cell mass. 
However, when islet β-cells are unable to compensate for 
insulin resistance, insulin deficiency develops, followed by 
T2D [112], which is increasingly being characterized as 
an inflammatory disease [113, 114]. Elevated circulating 
levels of acute-phase proteins, including CRP, fibrinogen, 
serum  amyloid  A,  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor, 
and  haptoglobin,  along  with  sialic  acid,  cytokines,  and 
chemokines,  have  been  observed  in  patients  with  T2D. 
Elevated  IL-1β,  IL-6,  TNF-α,  and  CRP  levels  are  also 
predictive of T2D. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is 
elevated  in  obesity  and  prediabetes  prior  to T2D  onset. 
Excessive nutrient levels, including those of glucose and 
free  fatty  acids,  promote  insulin  resistance.  T2D  also 
activates the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways, 
which can each promote tissue inflammation [110, 114, 
115]. Metabolic stressors also negatively impact pancreatic 
islet cells and insulin-sensitive tissues, including adipose 
tissue, promoting local cytokine and chemokine production 
and release. At the same time, immune cells, such as mast 
cells  and  macrophages,  are  recruited  and  contribute  to 

Figure 4: JAK-STAT pathway. Following IL-6 binding, signal is transduced by a receptor to activate the JAKs, which then activate 
STATs. STATs are dephosphorylated in the nucleus, leading to activation of downstream cytokines.

release from adipose tissues into the circulation promotes 
further inflammation in other tissues [116].    

Pancreas

pancreatic 

Pancreatitis, 

duct 
obstruction,  trypsinogen  gene  mutation,  or  alcoholism, 
is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas [117]. Acute 
pancreatitis (AP) incidence ranges from 4–45 per 100,000 
patients per year and increases annually by approximately 
1.3–4.0% in most developed countries. AP is one of the 
most common gastrointestinal causes for hospitalization in 
the US, and chronic pancreatitis (CP) is less common than 
AP. However, CP patients experience chronic abdominal 
insufficiency, 
pain  and  exocrine  and/or  endocrine 
leading  to  reduced  quality  of  life  [118].  Pancreatitis  is 
characterized by acinar cell destruction and activation of 
inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, 
and granulocytes, which secrete inflammatory cytokines 
[117,  119].  These  cytokines  further  activate  pancreatic 
stellate  cells  (PSCs)  to  promote  CP  [120].  Pancreatitis 
development requires various molecular pathways, such as 
NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT, which play critical roles 
in inflammatory cell activation during pancreatitis [117]. 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal 
of malignancies and a major health burden [121], and is the 
fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the US 
[118]. There is a strong link between antecedent CP and PC 
[122]. CP leads to fibrosis, which is a common pathological 
feature and major risk factor for PC [123]. Pancreatic cancer 
results from dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor 
genes, as well as growth factors and their receptors, including 
epidermal growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and many cytokines, 
such as TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, which modulate 
pathways involved in growth and differentiation [124, 125]. 
Shi,  et  al.  has  showed  that  VEGF  is  upregulated  by  low 
extracellular PH (acidosis), which occurs frequently around 
necrotic regions in tumors, and that acidosis activates IL-8 
[126]. VEGF and IL-8 are important angiogenic factors in 
PC [126], and acidosis-promoted upregulation of these genes 
can be mediated through NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation and 
cooperation [127]. 

Liver

Inflammation  in  the  liver  protects  this  organ  from 
infection and injury, but excessive inflammation may lead 
to  extensive  loss  of  hepatocytes,  ischemia-reperfusion 
injury,  metabolic  alterations,  and  eventually  permanent 
hepatic  damage  [128].  Inflammation  can  destroy  hepatic 
parenchymal  cells,  increasing  the  risk  of  chronic  liver 
diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver diseases are a leading cause 
of morbidity and mortality in the US [129].

The  liver  is  the  largest  solid  organ  in  the  body 
[130], and is a target of both infectious and non-infectious 
inflammatory  pathologies.  Infectious  inflammation  of 
the  liver  is  mainly  caused  by  microorganisms,  such  as 
bacterial  products,  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV),  or  hepatitis 
C  virus  (HCV)  [131,  132].  Sterile  inflammation  (SI)  is 
also  important  in  the  pathology  of  many  liver  diseases, 
such  as  alcoholic  or  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis,  drug-
induced liver injury, and ischemia/reperfusion [133–135]. 
In SI, endogenous DAMPs are released to injured tissues 
and  activate  immune  cells  [136]. While  pathogen-driven 
inflammation and SI differ, they share several functional 
characteristics.  Many  receptors  and  pathways  can  be 
activated by both PAMPs and DAMPs [137]. TLR4, for 
example,  can  be  activated  by  bacterial  LPS  and  cellular 
HMGB1.  Because  of  the  liver’s  unique  vascular  supply, 
PAMPs of intestinal origin and DAMPs from hepatocytes 
both contribute to inflammation in a variety of diseases. For 
example, PRR activation by DAMPs and PAMPs can induce 
production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  immune 
cell localization to sites of injury. Recognition of DAMPs 
and  PAMPs  results  in  assembly  of  the  inflammasome,  a 
cytosolic protein complex that activates the serine protease 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β and 
other cytokines. At the same time, Kupffer cell activation 
and  inflammatory  cell  recruitment  leads  to  production 
of  cytokines  and  chemokines  that  promote  long-term 
inflammation, hepatocyte damage, and/or cholestasis [138].

Lung

Lung  inflammatory  diseases  involve  complex 
interactions  among  and  between  structural  and  immune 
cells  [139].  Lung  inflammation  results  predominantly 
from tissue exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens, and/
or environmental pollutants. Excessive acute inflammation 
and subsequent lung injury can cause pulmonary fibrosis 
and  impair  gas  exchange.  Unresolved  lung  injury  and 
chronic  inflammation  are  frequently  observed  in  acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome,  cystic  fibrosis,  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma [140–
142]. Approximately 90% of COPD cases are associated 
with  cigarette  smoking-induced  inflammation  in  small 
airways and lung parenchyma [143]. Cigarette smoking is a 
major risk factor for COPD, which involves both systemic 
and  pulmonary  inflammation.  Long-term  smoking  can 
cause macrophage, neutrophil, and activated T lymphocyte 
infiltration  into  airways,  and  promote  production  of 
chemokines,  oxygen  radicals,  proteases,  and  cytokines, 
including that of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, in the lung [144].

Kidney

Kidney inflammation contributes to progressive renal 
injury,  which  may  lead  to  glomerulonephritis,  end-stage 
renal  disease,  or  acute  or  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD) 

Oncotargetwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget[145–147]. Approximately 10–12% of the population suffers 
from CKD, and some 50% of elderly patients show signs of 
kidney dysfunction, which is associated with high morbidity 
and mortality [52]. Kidney inflammation is most commonly 
induced by infection, ischemia/reperfusion, in situ immune-
complex  formation/deposition,  or  complement  pathway 
dysregulation [145]. CKD and acute kidney injury (AKI) 
are the most severe types of kidney disease [148]. Interstitial 
inflammation  and  tubular  injury  are  commonly  observed 
in  acute  and  chronic  kidney  injury  cases.  Renal  tubular 
epithelial  cells  are  likely  important  promoters  of  kidney 
inflammation, secreting a variety of inflammatory cytokines 
in response to both immune and non-immune factors, and 
leukocyte  infiltration  depends  on  the  local  presence  of 
these cytokines [146]. Stimuli that can induce kidney injury 
activate  transcription  factors  (NF-κB  or  MAPK).  These 
stimuli  include  cytokines,  growth  factors,  DAMPs,  and 
PAMPs, TLRs, Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and metabolic 
(high glucose, advanced glycosylation end products) and 
immune mediators [147].

Intestinal tract

Acute  and  chronic  inflammatory  diseases  of  the 
intestine  can  cause  various  health  issues,  and  decrease 
patient quality of life worldwide [149, 150]. The complex, 
polygenetic  inflammatory  bowel  diseases  (IBDs)  are 
characterized by an excessive inflammatory response to 
gut  lumen  microbial  flora  [151].  IBDs  mainly  include 
ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  and  Crohn  disease  (CD),  but 
also  noninfectious  inflammation  of  the  bowel  [152, 
153]. Idiopathic IBDs, such as CD and UC, are caused 
by  cytokine-driven,  non-infectious  inflammation  of 
the  gut.  For  example,  CD  is  associated  with  excessive 
IFN-γ/IL-17  and  IL-12/IL-23  production,  while  UC  is 
associated with excess IL-13 [153]. Thus, IBD appears to 
be the result of a dysfunctional interaction between gut 
bacteria  and  the  mucosal  immune  system  [154]. A  key 
process in the immune system’s response to microbes is 
the recognition of microbial agents via PRRs, including 
TLRs  and  nucleotide-binding  oligomerization  domain 
containing NLRs, which sense evolutionarily conserved 
PAMPs  [155].  Upon  PAMP  detection,  PRRs  activate 
intracellular signaling pathways that induce production of 
cytokines and chemokines to promote host resistance to 
infection. TLR (mainly TLR4) signaling induces NF-κB 
and MAPK transcription. At the same time, NLRs are also 
activated through ligand detection [154], in turn activating 
caspase-1, followed by activation and secretion of IL-1β, 
interleukin-18 and other cytokines [154].

Reproductive system

ovulation,  and  parturition  trigger  the  inflammatory 
cascade.  However, 
initiation  and  maintenance  of 
inflammatory  processes  are  also  important  components 
of  many  reproductive  tract  diseases.  Damaged  tissues 
locally release inflammatory interleukins, growth factors, 
cytokines,  and  prostaglandins,  which  activate  signaling 
pathways  and  recruit  immune  cells  (e.g.  neutrophils 
and  macrophages)  to  the  site  of  injury.  This  process 
synergistically controls tissue remodeling and repair, but 
can also induce inflammatory diseases [7]. Inflammatory 
cytokines, including IL-6, are the primary mediators of 
inflammation-related  reproductive  tract  diseases,  and 
act via signal transduction pathways such as the MAPK 
pathway [157, 158].

Brain

Inflammatory  responses  occur  in  the  brain  in 
many  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  diseases,  including 
autoimmune  diseases,  neurodegenerative  diseases  like 
Alzheimer’s  (AD)  and  Parkinson’s  disease  (PD),  and 
epilepsy. Inflammatory responses in the brain can enhance 
neuronal  excitability,  injure  cells,  and  increase  blood-
brain  barrier  permeability  to  various  molecules  [159–
161].  Inflammation-associated  CNS  diseases  result  from 
activation of the brain’s resident immune cells and microglia, 
which  produce  pro-inflammatory  markers  [162].  These 
inflammation  processes  also  involve  both  the  innate  and 
adaptive immune systems and resemble immune responses 
to  systemic  infection.  Cytokines  and  TLRs  are  major 
inflammatory  mediators  in  the  transition  between  innate 
and adaptive. Inflammatory responses in the CNS may also 
be triggered by endogenous ligands recognized by TLRs. 
DAMPs,  such  as  heat-shock  proteins  and  extracellular 
matrix degradation molecules, entering the brain through 
a damaged blood-brain barrier may initiate inflammatory 
responses.  The  CNS  inflammatory  response  is  strong  in 
reaction to both infectious agents and brain injury, such as 
tissue damage observed following ischemic, traumatic, or 
excitotoxic brain injury, or seizure [160, 163, 164].

CONCLUSIONS

Inflammation  is  frequently  a  key  element  in  the 
pathological  progression  of  organ  disease.  Three  main 
pathways,  NF-κB,  MAPK,  and  JAK-STAT,  play  major 
roles in inflammation, and dysregulation of one or more 
of these pathways may lead to inflammation-associated 
disease. A better understanding of inflammatory response 
pathways  and  molecular  mechanisms  will  undoubtedly 
contribute  to  improved  prevention  and  treatment  of 
inflammatory diseases.

The  hallmarks  of  inflammation  are  observed 
during  many  normal  reproductive  processes,  including 
menstruation,  ovulation,  implantation,  and  parturition 
[156].  Injury  and  healing  caused  by  menstruation,

Purpose: Sepsis is an aggressive and life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by infection. Excessive inflammation and coagula-
tion  contribute  to  the  negative  outcomes  for  sepsis,  resulting  in  high  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  this  study,  we  explored  whether 
Eupatilin could alleviate lung injury, reduce inflammation and coagulation during sepsis.
Methods:  We  constructed  an  in  vitro  sepsis  model  by  stimulating  RAW264.7  cells  with  1  μg/mL  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  for  6 
hours. The cells were divided into control group, LPS group, LPS+ Eupatilin (Eup) group, and Eup group to detect their cell activity 
and inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factor levels. Cells in LPS+Eup and Eup group were pretreated with Eupatilin (10μM) for 
2 hours. In vivo, mice were divided into sham operation group, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) group and Eup group. Mice in the 
CLP  and  Eup  groups  were  pretreated  with  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  for  2  hours  by  gavage.  Lung  tissue  and  plasma  were  collected  and 
inflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors and signaling were measured.
Results:  In  vitro,  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-α,  interleukin  (IL)-1β,  IL-6,  and  tissue  factor  (TF)  expression  in  LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7  cells  was  downregulated  by  Eupatilin  (10μM).  Furthermore,  Eupatilin  inhibited  phosphorylation  of  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway and suppressed p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. In vivo, Eupatilin increased the survival rate of the mice. In septic 
mice, plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as TF, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), D-dimer, thrombin- 
antithrombin complex (TAT) and fibrinogen were improved by Eupatilin. Moreover, Eupatilin alleviated lung injury by improving the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF, fibrin deposition and macrophage infiltration in lung tissue.
Conclusion: Our results revealed that Eupatilin may modulate inflammation and coagulation indicators as well as improve lung injury 
in sepsis via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
Keywords: Eupatilin, sepsis, inflammation, coagulation, JAK2/STAT3

Introduction
Sepsis  is  a  life-threatening  organ  dysfunction  caused  by  infection,  which  results  from  dysregulated  host  response.1 
A study reported in Lancet showed that sepsis remains a major cause of health loss worldwide, with 48.9 million cases 
each year and approximately 11 million deaths, which accounts around one-fifth of the total global deaths.2 According to 
Nature Reviews Disease Primers, more than half of sepsis patients are complicated with coagulation system imbalance.3 
Moreover,  in  patients  who  have  sepsis  with  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC)  the  mortality  rate  is  almost

twice that of sepsis patients without DIC.4  Therefore, reducing inflammation and coagulation disorders could be the key 
to reducing sepsis mortality.

Macrophages  are  involved  in  various  pathophysiological  processes  in  sepsis,  including  inflammation,  coagulation, 
immunity  and  metabolism,  and  play  a  crucial  role  in  sepsis-induced  acute  lung  injury.5,6  In  the  early  stages  of  sepsis, 
macrophages  engulf  pathogens  and  activate  the  innate  immune  system.  Macrophages  express  pattern  recognition 
receptors  (PRRs),  which  can  detect  pathogen-associated  molecular  patterns  (PAMPs)  or  damage-associated  molecular 
patterns (DAMPs), initiating a series of immune cell activations and upregulating the expression of inflammation-related 
genes, that produce a series of inflammatory cytokines.7 In this process, the body targets pathogens to contain, kill and/or 
expel  them.  However,  there  is  also  a  defense  strategy,  called  disease  tolerance,  which  refers  to  limiting  the  negative 
impact of infection on the host without affecting the pathogen load.8  The expression of high levels of PRRs and other 
receptors, including cytokines by tissue-resident macrophages contributes to the establishment of disease tolerance.9  In 
addition,  signal  transduction  pathways  that  are  activated  in  response  to  PAMPs  or  DAMPs  also  contribute  to  tissue 
damage control and establishment of disease tolerance, both of which limit the negative effects of infection.

Lipopolysaccharide  (LPS),  an  important  cell  wall  constituent  of  Gram-negative  bacteria,  is  a  potent  inducer  of 
inflammatory  responses.10  After  exposure  to  LPS,  macrophages  produce  large  amounts  of  inflammatory  cytokines, 
interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).11 Recent studies have shown that monocytes and macrophages, 
especially  those  from  myeloid  origin,  are  main  cell  types  that  express  tissue  factor  (TF),  which  causes  pathological 
coagulation in sepsis.12,13  In severe sepsis, macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators and the coagulation system is 
activated, which promotes fibrin production and thrombosis.14,15  In addition, coagulation abnormalities contribute to the 
lethality of sepsis and septic acute lung injury (ALI).16 Many in vivo studies use cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model 
in mice, which can simulate the pathological condition of abdominal infection through cecal contamination and, to some 
extent, mimic the response of clinical patients with sepsis.17,18  Thus, we conducted sepsis model using LPS-stimulated 
RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP-induced mice in our study.

Eupatilin (Eup) is a lipophilic flavonoid isolated from Artemisia argyi, which has the effect of warming the meridian 
to stop bleeding, dispersing cold and relieving pain. In recent years, Eupatilin has been found to have biological activities 
against  inflammation,  oxidation,  and  tumors.19  It  has  antioxidant  and  anti-apoptotic  effects  against  cisplatin-induced 
ototoxicity,  as  well  as  inhibiting  inflammatory  responses  and  aging  in  nucleus  pulposus  (NP)  cells.20,21  In  addition, 
a derivative of Eupatilin to treat dry eye disease is being developed and is undergoing Phase I study.22 Eupatilin can also 
reduce  the  inflammatory  response  in  LPS-induced  rats,  decreasing  the  level  of  surfactant  protein  (SP)-A,  SP-D,  and 
inflammatory  factors.23  Moreover,  Eupatilin  can  reduce  the  number  of  inflammatory  cells  in  OVA-induced  asthmatic 
mice  and  inhibit  the  NF-κB  and  MAPK  pathways  in  both  mice  and  RAW264.7  cells.24  Besides,  by inhibiting  STAT3, 
Eupatilin  attenuates  airway  remodeling  and  inhibits  gastric  cancer  cell  growth.25,26  A  recent  study  has  shown  that 
Eupatilin  is  associated  with  coagulation.  It  can  inhibit  arachidonic  acid  (AA)-induced  platelet  aggregation  and  throm-
boxane  A2  (TXA2)  and  5-hydroxytryptophan  (5-HT)  generation.27  Nevertheless,  the  underlying  mechanisms  and 
whether  it  can  be  used  to  protect  sepsis-induced  coagulation  disorders  is  unclear.  Besides,  our  previous  study  has 
shown that in sepsis, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 can affect the coagulation and inflammation systems, resulting 
in fatal damage.28

Thus,  we  hypothesized  that  Eupatilin  can  exert  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-coagulation  effects  in  LPS-induced 

RAW264.7 macrophages and CLP mouse model by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China).

Preparation of Eupatilin
In the in vitro experiments, Eupatilin was dissolved in DMSO to form a stock solution with a final concentration of 10 
mM,  and  stored  at  −80°C.  In  the  in  vivo  experiments,  Eupatilin  was  dissolved  in  80%  corn  oil  and  20%  DMSO  at 
a concentration of 10 mg/mL; the solution was used immediately after preparation.

In vitro
Cell Culture and Intervention
RAW264.7 macrophages were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultivated in DMEM with 10% FBS. 
The cells were maintained in an incubator at 37°C with a 5%CO2 level. Cells were randomly classified into four groups: 
control (CON) group, LPS group, LPS + Eup group, and Eup group. The LPS group was stimulated with 1 μg/mL LPS 
for 6 hours,30  while the LPS + Eup group was treated with 10 μM Eupatilin for 2 hours, followed by LPS for 6 hours. 
The Eup group was treated only with 10 μM Eupatilin, which was added the same time as LPS+ Eup group.

Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay
The effects of Eupatilin on the proliferation of RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. The day 
before stimulation, RAW264.7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.0×104 cells/well. After 24 hours, the 
supernatant was replaced with fresh medium. The CCK-8 solution was then added into each well, and the mixture was 
incubated  at  37°C.  After  2  hours,  the  optical  density  at  450  nm  was  measured  using  a  microplate  reader  (Molecular 
Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).

Real Time Quantitative PCR
In  accordance  with  the  instructions,  the  total  RNA  from  RAW264.7  cells  was  extracted  and  1000  ng  of  RNA  was 
transformed into 20 μL cDNA using the reagents listed above. The cDNA was then stored at -80°C. The RT-qPCR was 
performed  using  SYBR  Green  on  a  PCR  detection  system  (7500fast,  USA).  The  cycling  conditions  were  as  follows: 
initial denaturation at 95°C for 60s, then denaturation at 95°C for 15s, annealing at 60°C for 30s, and extension at 72°C 
for  45s,  the  three  steps  above  cycled  for  40  times.  The  results  were  normalized  to  GAPDH  and  the  statistics  were 
calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. The  primer pair  sequences for mice  were from Generay Biotech (Shanghai, China) 
and listed in Table 1.

In vivo
Experimental Animals
We obtained male C57BL/6 mice at the age of 6–8 weeks and the weight of 18–25 g from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory, 
Animal Limited Liability Company (SCXK (ZHE) 2019–0001). According to the local animal welfare policy, the mice 
were raised in a specific pathogen-free laboratory animal environment, in which the temperature maintained at 23 ± 3°C, 
the  humidity  kept  at  55%  ±  10%,  and  the  light/dark  cycle  controlled  at  12:12.  During  the  study,  the  mice  were  fed 
a normal diet. All animal experiments were complied with the requirements of the Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Wenzhou Medical University.  The animal  experimentation protocol  was granted by the Ethics Committee  of Wenzhou 
Medical University (YS2018-088, 2018.02.26).

Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) and Animal Tests
The  mice  were  randomly  assigned  into  three  groups  according  to  the  random  number  table  method:  sham  operation 
(SHAM) group, CLP group, CLP + Eup group. After the processing time, each group contained more than six samples. 
The  mice  were  anesthetized  by  1%  sodium  pentobarbital  (Solarbio,  China)  according  to  their  weight  (100  μL/10  g) 
before operation. After the mice were anesthetized, we opened the abdominal cavity and carefully exposed the cecum, 
which was then ligated at 1 cm from the end and punched through by a needle (21-gauge). Subsequently, the feces were 
squeezed  out  into  the  abdomen  and  the  cecum  was  placed  back.  Finally,  the  abdominal  cavity  was  closed.31  Similar 
procedures  without  ligation  and  puncture  were  used  in  the  SHAM  group.  For  the  CLP+Eup  group,  the  mice  were 
administered  Eupatilin  (10mg/kg)  by  gavage  2  hours  before  operation.  After  surgery,  each  mouse  was  immediately 
resuscitated  by  subcutaneous  injection  of  1  mL  warm  saline.  The  experimental  samples  were  collected  24  hours  after 
surgery. Besides, survival analysis was performed and lasted for 72 hours, with 10 mice per group, during which the mice 
were monitored every 6 hours and euthanized at the point of moribundity.

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining
The  lung  tissue  from  three  groups  of  mice  were  collected,  fixed  in  4%  paraformaldehyde,  dehydrated,  embedded,  and 
sliced into 4-μm-thick sections. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the slices were stained by H&E staining kit. 
Then,  the  severity  of  lung  injury  was  evaluated  based  on  inflammatory  cell  infiltration,  edema  and  congestion.  The 
pulmonary injury was scored as follows: 0 point for no injury, 1 point for <25% of the field injured, 2 points for 25% to 
50% of the field injured, 3 points for 50% to 75% of the field injured, and 4 points for >75% of the field injured.32  Each 
slide  had  six  microscopic  fields  analyzed,  and  the  average  was  taken  as  the  final  score  for  each  lung  tissue.  Lung 
histological analyses were performed in a blinded manner.

Immunohistochemical Assay
The lung slices were dewaxed and rehydrated. Then, the antigen in slices was retrieved in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) 
for  10  minutes  using  a  microwave  oven,  followed  by  quenching  of  endogenous  peroxidase  for  15  minutes.  Next,  the 
sections  were  blocked  with  5%  BSA  for  an  hour.  The  slices  were  then  incubated  with  rabbit  anti-fibrinogen  antibody 
(Abcam,  Catalog  No:  ab34269)  overnight  at  4°C.  The  next  day,  the  slices  were  incubated  at  37°C  for  1h  with  HRP- 
conjugated  goat  anti-rabbit  antibody.  Subsequently,  the  slices  were  stained  using  a  DAB  kit  and  observed  under 
a microscope.

Elisa Test
The  supernatants  from  RAW264.7  cell  were  collected,  centrifuged  at  1000  ×  g  for  10  minutes  and  stored  at  −20°C. 
Twenty-four hours after surgery, the plasma was collected from mice using anticoagulant tubes with 3.2% sodium citrate. 
The tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 minutes and stored at − 80°C. The experiment was performed according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  catalog  numbers  for  the  reagent  kits  were  as  follows:  IL-1β  (Catalog  No:70- 
EK201B),  IL-6  (Catalog  No:70-EK206)  and  TNF-α  (Catalog  No:70-EK282)  from  MultiScience,  China.  TF  (Catalog 
No:  DY3178-05)  and  Plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  (PAI)-1  (Catalog  No:  DY3828-05)  from  R&D  Systems,  USA. 
D-dimer  (Catalog  No:  CSB-E13584m),  Fibrinogen  (Catalog  No:  CSB-E08202m)  and  thrombin-antithrombin  complex 
(TAT) (Catalog No: CSB-E08433m) from Cusabio, China.

Western Blotting
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  lung  tissue  from  mice  were  dissociated  by  RIPA  buffer  with  10%  protein  phosphatase 
inhibitor and 1% PMSF. After measuring the protein concentrations using the BCA kit, lysates containing 20 µg protein 
samples were separated on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After that, the proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF 
membranes  in  a  cold  condition;  these  membranes  were  then  blocked  using  5%  skim  milk  in  1  ×  TBST  buffer  for  1.5 
hours at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. 
On the second day, the membranes were incubated with goat HRP-conjugated IgG antibodies (Catalog No: SA00001-2 
for anti-rabbit or Catalog No: SA00001-1 for anti-mice, Proteintech, China) for 1 hour at room temperature. The proteins 
were then visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence reagent. The primary antibodies were as follows: STAT3 (Catalog 
No:  9139S)  and  p-STAT3  (Try705)  (Catalog  No:  9145S)  from  Cell  Signaling  Technology,  USA.  TF  (Catalog  No: 
DF6400), IL-6 (Catalog No: DF6087), TNF-α (Catalog No: AF7014), IL-1β (Catalog No: AF5103), GAPDH (Catalog 
No: AF7021), Tubulin (Catalog No: AF7011), and Histone H3 (Catalog No: BF9211) are from Affinity, China. p-JAK2 
(pY1007+Y1008) (Catalog  No:  ab32101),  JAK2  (Catalog  No:  ab108596),  thrombin  (Catalog  No:  ab92621) and  PAI-1 
(Catalog  No:  ab222754)  from  Abcam  (Cambridge,  United  Kingdom).  The  internal  reference  proteins  in  this  study 
included GAPDH, Tubulin, and Histone H3. ImageJ software (NIH, USA) was used to quantify the protein bands.

Immunofluorescence
For  cell  immunofluorescence,  macrophages  were  fixed  with  4%  paraformaldehyde  for  10  min,  permeabilized  in  0.2% 
Triton  X-100  for  15  minutes,  and  blocked  in  5%  BSA  for  30  minutes.  All  the  operations  were  performed  at  room 
temperature.  Then,  the  cells  are  incubated  with  p-STAT3  primary  antibodies  overnight  at  4°C,  followed  by  incubation 
with FITC secondary antibodies against the appropriate sources for 1 hour at 37°C (Catalog No: BL031A for anti-mice or 
Catalog  No:  BL033A  for  anti-rabbit,  Biosharp).  Thereafter,  the  sections  were  mounted  using  an  anti-fluorescence 
quencher containing DAPI (Catalog No:36308ES11, Yeasen, China).

For tissue immunofluorescence staining, lung sections were treated the same way as for immunohistochemistry, then 
incubated  with  the  F4/80  (Catalog  No:  sc-377009,  Santa  Cruz)  and  TF  (Catalog  No:  DF6400,  Affinity)  primary 
antibodies overnight at 4°C. The following day, the slides were performed in the same way as for cell immunofluores-
cence.  Finally,  we  visualized  the  fluorescence  signal  in  the  tissue  and  cells  using  a  laser  confocal  microscope  (Nikon, 
Japan). The statistical significance was estimated using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).

Statistical Analyses
GraphPad Prism  9.0.0  (GraphPad  Software,  USA)  was  used  for  the  statistical  analysis. Each  experiment  was  indepen-
dently  carried  out  in  at  least  three  duplicates.  Values  were  presented  as  mean ± SD.  P  <  0.05  was  considered  to  be 
statistically  significant.  After  evaluating  normality  and  variance  in  each  group,  the  group  differences  were  examined 
using  one-way  ANOVA,  followed  by  Tukey’s  post-hoc  multiple  comparison  test.  The  analysis  was  carried  out  to 
determine the statistical methods for comparison between groups. The Log rank test was used to compare the survival 
time in each group of mice.

Effects of Eupatilin on Cell Viability
To assess the effect of Eupatilin on cell viability and cytotoxicity, we examined the effect of Eupatilin on RAW 264.7 
macrophages  using  the  CCK8  assay.  As  shown  in  Figure  1B,  the  cell  viability  of  RAW  264.7  macrophages  was  little 
affected  within  24  hours  at  concentrations  less  than  10μM.  Thus,  in  the  following  experiments,  we  used  a  10μM 
concentration  of  Eupatilin  to  eliminate  any  potential  cytotoxic  effect.  Besides,  the  result  of  CCK8  also  showed  that 
LPS  induced  cell  proliferation  in  macrophages,  while  Eupatilin  could  inhibit  the  LPS-induced  cell  proliferation 
(Figure 1C).

Eupatilin Decreased the Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and TF in LPS-Induced 
RAW264.7 Cells
To explore the effect of Eupatilin, we measured inflammatory cytokines and TF levels in RAW264.7 cells six hours after 
LPS stimulation. As shown in Figure 1D-F, after the stimulation with LPS, the mRNA expression raised sharply in TNF- 
α (25.15±4.10), IL-1β (3753.55±114.04) and IL-6 (36976.14±1121.44). However, pretreatment with Eupatilin apparently 
attenuated  the  LPS-induced  increase  in  inflammatory  cytokine  expression.  TF  is  a  major  promoter  of  coagulation.  As 
shown in Figure 1G, Eupatilin apparently inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression of TF (84.66±4.86 in LPS group vs 
48.49±3.39 in LPS+Eup group).

Western blot and ELISA were performed to examine the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TF at the protein 
level. In the supernatants from the LPS group, the concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were higher than the control 
group, whereas this increase was significantly reduced in the LPS + Eup group (Figure 1H-J, 19,615.96±714.41pg/mL, 
26.24±2.44pg/mL and 2590.58±109.74pg/mL in LPS group vs 17,095.77±140.07pg/mL, 19.10±1.79pg/mL and 1796.74 
±256.63pg/mL  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively).  Moreover,  the  Western  blot  results  illustrated  that  pretreatment  with 
Eupatilin significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 1K-N). Both 
the Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated the reduction in the expression of inflammation indicators in the RAW 
264.7 cells after using Eupatilin. Western blot analysis also revealed a decrease in TF expression in the LPS + Eup group 
(Figure 1K and O).

Eupatilin Regulated LPS-Induced Inflammation and Coagulation by Suppressing JAK2/ 
STAT3 Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells
To  observe  whether  Eupatilin-mediated  effects  on  inflammation  and  coagulation  were  linked  to  the  JAK2/STAT3 
signaling  pathway,  we  performed  Western  blot  in  RAW264.7  cells  to  detect  the  phosphorylation  of  target  proteins. 
Compared with the CON group, the LPS group had significantly higher expression levels of both p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. 
However,  after  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin,  the  expression  levels  of  both  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  were  diminished 
(Figure  2A-C,  1.48±0.02  and  3.10±0.14  in  LPS  group  vs  1.21±0.06  and  2.38±0.11  in  LPS+Eup  group,  respectively). 
AG490  is  an  inhibitor  of  JAK2,  which  reduced  the  phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  (Figure  2D).  Western  blot 
analysis  revealed  that  AG490  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  both  STAT3  and  JAK2,  while  Eupatilin  pretreatment 
strengthened this inhibition (Figure 2E-G). Moreover, comparing with CLP group, the use of AG490 could reduce the 
expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TF (Figure 2H-K, 15.09±1.61, 1843.46±85.28, 18,345.62±427.00, and 55.24±1.82 
in  LPS  group  vs  11.71±0.17,  1170.53±41.54,  4321.65±241.26,  and  38.15±3.08  in  LPS+AG490  group,  respectively), 
while the use of Eupatilin strengthened this inhibition.

To  verify  whether  Eupatilin  pretreatment  can  reduce  p-STAT3  nuclear  translocation  in  LPS-stimulated  RAW264.7 
cells,  both  Western  blot  and  immunofluorescence  were  performed.  Western  blot  analysis  showed  that  the  pretreatment 
with  Eupatilin  attenuated  the  expression  of  p-STAT3  in  nucleus  (Figure  3A).  In  addition,  cell  immunofluorescence 
showed  a  reduction  in  the  nuclear  translocation  of  p-STAT3  after  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  in  RAW264.7  cells 
(Figure 3B).

expression levels of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were normalized to JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. (H-K) The differences in TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and TF mRNA 
expression were determined by RT-qPCR. Before receiving LPS (1 μg/mL) for 6 hours, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with AG490 (10 µM) for 1 hour. n≥3 per group, one- 
way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001, versus LPS group; $ p < 0.05, $$ p < 0.01, $$$ p < 0.001, versus LPS+AG490 
group.

Eupatilin Increased Survival Rate and Improved Inflammation and Coagulation in Septic 
Mice
To investigate the effect of Eupatilin on the survival rate of septic mice, we established a model using CLP with C57BL/6 
mice and calculated the 72-hour survival rate. The results showed that compared with SHAM group, the survival rate in 
CLP group dropped sharply (Figure 4A, 1/10,10% in CLP group vs 10/10,100% in SHAM group). Moreover, compared 
to mice in CLP group, the survival rate in CLP+Eup group increased (5/10, 50%).

Figure 3 Effects of Eupatilin on the translocation of p-STAT3 into the nuclei in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with LPS. (A) The protein levels of p-STAT3 in the nuclei of 
RAW264.7 cells were determined by Western blot. (B) p-STAT3 (green) fluorescence images of RAW264.7 cells (scale bar: 50 µm, 600 ×) were captured under a confocal 
laser microscope. n≥3 per group, one-way ANOVA test. ***p < 0.001, versus CON group; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, versus LPS group.

To  explore  whether  Eupatilin  improves  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  mouse  model,  ELISA was  performed.  As 
anticipated,  the  level  of  inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  TNF-α,  IL-1β  and  IL-6  (241.72±30.17pg/mL,  33.59±2.25pg/ 
mL,  213.99±75.66ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  141.52±19.96pg/mL,  25.80±4.05pg/mL,  41.36±17.86ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup 
group,  respectively),  as  well  as  coagulation  factors,  such  as  TF,  TAT,  PAI-1  and  D-dimer  (82.24±4.89pg/mL,  42.79 
±8.39ng/mL,  233.75±82.02ng/mL,  31.80±3.14ng/mL  in  CLP  group  vs  68.21±  2.50pg/mL,  12.60±2.90ng/mL,  23.91 
±21.07ng/mL,  23.33±1.78ng/mL  in  CLP+Eup  group,  respectively),  were  lower  in  the  plasma  for  mice  in  CLP+Eup 
group (Figure 4B-H) than those in the CLP group. In addition, compared with the SHAM group, the fibrinogen level in 
plasma  was  decreased  in  the  CLP  group,  while  the  pretreatment  with  Eupatilin  reversed  this  trend  (Figure  4I,  497.13 
±21.69µg/mL in CLP group vs 705.19±138.68µg/mL in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Eupatilin Alleviated Pulmonary Inflammation and Lung Injury in Septic Mice
We performed H&E staining to detect lung injury. H&E staining revealed that in the CLP models, the alveolar wall was 
thickened, hyaline membranes were formed, and neutrophils had accumulated in the interstitial space. As anticipated, the 
CLP+Eup group exhibited slighter lung tissue injury (Figure 5A). Moreover, the expression of inflammatory cytokines in 
lung tissue among the three groups was analyzed. As shown in Figure 5B-E, Eupatilin reduced the expression of TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 in lung tissue of mice. Macrophages initiate the primary inflammatory process, and F4/80 is a biomarker 
for them. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the CLP group had stronger F4/80 fluorescent signals than the 
sham group, while Eupatilin pretreatment decreased these signals (Figure 5F).

Eupatilin Reduced Coagulation and Fibrin Deposition in the Lung Tissue of Septic Mice
We used Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to investigate whether Eupatilin reduces 
coagulation  in  lung  tissue.  The  exposure  of  TF  is  the  way  to  promote  coagulation.  The  results  of  Western  blot  and 
immunofluorescence showed that Eupatilin could lower the exposure of TF in the lung tissue of septic mice (Figure 6A, 
B  and  E). Furthermore,  Western blot showed  decreased  expression  levels of  thrombin,  and PAI-1  in the lung  tissue  of 
septic mice after Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 6A, C and D). Additionally, according to immunohistochemistry results, 
fibrin deposition (brown stain) was observed in the CLP group. However, the amount of fibrin deposition was less in the 
lung tissue from mice pretreated with Eupatilin (Figure 6F).

Eupatilin Suppressed the Activation of JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway in the Lung 
Tissue of Septic Mice
To explore the effect of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we extracted proteins from the lung tissue of septic mice. 
The  Western  blot  analysis  revealed  that  the  expression  of  p-JAK2  and  p-STAT3  was  considerably  higher  in  the  CLP 
group than in the SHAM  group, and decreased  with  Eupatilin pretreatment (Figure 7A-C,  1.79±0.24 and  2.21±0.20 in 
CLP group vs 1.24±0.16 and 1.11±0.15 in CLP+Eup group, respectively).

Discussion
One  of  the  pathological  features  of  sepsis  is  the  hyperactivation  of  inflammation  and  coagulation  systems;  both  can 
promote  and  impact  upon  each  other.33  In  the  present  study,  we  found  that  Eupatilin  reduced  the  expression  of 
inflammatory  factors  and  tissue  factors  in  LPS-induced  RAW264.7  cells  in  vitro  and  increased  the  survival  of  CLP 
mice. In vivo, Eupatilin attenuated lung injury and reduced inflammatory infiltration and coagulation activation in CLP

mice.  In  summary,  our  research  revealed  that  Eupatilin  could  protect  septic  mice  from  lung  injury,  by  improving 
inflammation and coagulation, and that this protection was linked to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Ample evidence suggests extensive interaction between inflammation and coagulation, with inflammation activating 
coagulation  and  coagulation  greatly  influencing  inflammatory  activity.34  In  sepsis  patients,  high  concentrations  of 
cytokines  can  be  found  in  blood  circulation.15  The  first  mediator  identified  is  TNF,  which  is  then  followed  by  various 
IL with noticeably elevated levels—IL-6 and IL-1 being the most significant.35 Our research showed that, in both in vivo 
and in vitro sepsis models, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were increased.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines have the ability to stimulate coagulation in vitro. TF is the main factor in the coagulation 
process  and  is  also  a  link  between  coagulation  and  inflammation.36–39  Under  normal  physiological  conditions,  mono-
cytes,  endothelial  cells  and  epithelial  cells  have  low  TF  expression.40  However,  during  sepsis,  these  cells  express  and 
release TF into circulation after being stimulated by inflammatory factors and LPS.13,41  Besides, after LPS stimulation, 
caspase-11 is activated, followed by gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores formed and phosphatidylserine exposure, triggering 
the  coagulation  cascade.42  Previous  research  has  also  demonstrated  that  blocking  IL-6  inhibits  endotoxin-induced 
coagulation  activation.43  Numerous  investigations  have  shown  that  the  stimulation  of  human  monocytes  with  LPS 
increases  TF  expression.40,44  Moreover,  healthy  humans  who  received  a  low-dose  endotoxemia  injection  had  a  125- 
fold increase in the amount of TF mRNA in their circulating monocytes.45,46  In a model of endotoxemia, early research 
showed  that  inhibiting  the  expression  of  TF  attenuated  septic  shock,  and  animals  with  low  TF  levels  had  decreased

Figure 7 Effects of Eupatilin on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways in lung tissue of septic mice. (A-C) The phosphorylation levels of JAK2 and STAT3 in septic mice were 
analyzed by Western blot. The relative expression levels of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were normalized to JAK2 and STAT3, respectively. n≥3 per group, one-way

coagulation,  inflammation,  and  mortality.47  In  our  study,  we  discovered  that  TF  expression  was  noticeably  higher  in 
sepsis models, while the pretreatment with Eupatilin reversed these changes.

After  the  release  of  TF,  it  binds  to  activated  factor  VII(VIIa),  forming  the  TF–FVIIa  complex,  which  can  induce 
a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages.48  The TF–VIIa complex then activates factor X and initiates coagulation 
activation.  Factor  Xa,  together  with  factor  Va,  forms  the  prothrombinase  complex,  which  subsequently  converts 
prothrombin  to  thrombin.49  It  can  amplify  inflammation  by  binding  to  platelets  and  protease  activated  receptor  1 
(PAR-1).50  Thrombin  then  cleaves  fibrinogen  into  fibrin,51  and  fibrin  degradation  products can  induce  IL-6  production 
by monocytes in vitro.52  Moreover, fibrin degradation can elevate the levels of D-dimer. This process produces higher 
levels of PAI-1, and the overproduction of which will impair fibrinolysis.53  Increased fibrin formation due to impaired 
fibrinolysis causes organ injury and mortality in sepsis.54

According to a number of studies, the STAT3 signaling pathway can regulate inflammatory responses in LPS-induced 
macrophages  and  acute  lung  injury,  including  the  production  and  release  of  inflammatory  factors.55–58  In  our  previous 
study, we found that activation of the nuclear transcription factor STAT3 through phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 site 
induced TF expression and facilitated the onset of coagulation dysfunction in sepsis.28 In addition, the use of the STAT3 
inhibitor BP-1-102 decreased the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TF 
in RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, our present experiments detected phosphorylation of STAT3 in both mice lung tissue and 
LPS-stimulated macrophages sepsis models, and increased intranuclear phosphorylation was found in macrophages, both 
of which are in agreement with previous studies.29

However,  other  mechanisms  may  also  be  involved  in  Eupatilin’s  effects.  Studies  have  shown  that  Eupatilin  is 
a  selective  PPARα-receptor  agonist,  the  activation  of  PPARα  may  be  related  to  the  alleviation  of  inflammation  and 
oxidative  stress  in  LPS-induced  ALI.23,59  Eupatilin  has  also  been  found  to  reduce  the  expression  of  inflammatory 
cytokines by inhibiting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).60  However, whether it has specific receptors requires further study. 
In addition, Eupatilin may also play a role in other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, MAPK and Nrf2 pathways.24,61 
Thus,  whether  these  pathways  also  play  a  role  in  regulating  inflammation  and  coagulation  in  sepsis  needs  further 
investigation.  According  to  one  study,  Eupatilin  can  lower  the  expression  of  inflammatory  mediators  by  inhibiting  the 
NF-κB signaling pathway in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages.62  However, the specific mechanism of its regulation of 
macrophages and its effect on pathogens has not been elucidated yet.

In our study, we found that the effect of Eupatilin pretreatment on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and tissue 
factors  was  consistent  in  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  experiments.  Eupatilin-mediated  effects in  vivo  were  maintained  in 
both plasma and lung tissues. Moreover, the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was observed in both lung 
tissue and cells after Eupatilin pretreatment. Similar to Eupatilin, another plant-based molecule, piperlongumin, also has

regulatory effects on inflammation and  coagulation in severe infections,  and further studies are needed to  compare the 
effects of these compounds.29

However, our study also has some limitations. First of all, endothelial cells also play an important role in inflamma-
tion and coagulation disorders caused by sepsis. However, we did not perform analysis on endothelial cells in the present 
study. Secondly, the study was performed only in C57BL/6 mice and was not validated in other murine species. Finally, 
we only used a single dose and intervention time in our study, so further studies should be conducted to investigate the 
optimum concentration and intervention time for Eupatilin-related effects.

Conclusion
Our results confirmed that Eupatilin can reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation factors in both 
RAW264.7  macrophages  and  mouse  sepsis  models.  It  also  increased  survival  and  attenuated  lung  injury  in  mice  with 
sepsis.  The  mechanism  for  this  may  involve  the  inhibition  of  JAK2/STAT3  activation  and  the  reduction  of  p-STAT3 
nuclear  translocation,  thereby  regulating  inflammatory  cytokines  and  coagulation  factors.  Additionally,  the  potential 
mechanisms and effects of Eupatilin on other organs in sepsis require further investigation.

Purpose: Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes citrullination, a post-translational
modiﬁcation that can alter structure, function and antigenicity of proteins. Citrullination in
the lungs due to smoking is believed to initiate an anti-citrulline immune response in
rheumatoid arthritis. Citrullination in other inﬂamed organs has also been demonstrated,
but it is not known whether smoking or inﬂammatory processes in general result in release of
relevant amounts of PAD into the circulation with potential to cause citrullination of proteins
at various anatomical sites. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) induces an acute systemic inﬂammation response. In the present study, we
investigate whether smoking or acute systemic inﬂammation causes release of PAD into the
circulation.
Patients and methods: This study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease (16
smokers and 20 non-smokers) undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Circulating levels of
PAD2 and PAD4, PAD activity,
the neutrophil activation markers MPO, MMP-9 and
lipocalin-2, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL8 were measured 2 hrs
preoperatively and 2 hrs postoperatively.
Results: At baseline, serum PAD2 and PAD4 concentration did not differ between smokers
and non-smokers. However, serum from non-smokers contained higher PAD activity than
serum from smokers. Circulating PAD2 levels and PAD activity increased markedly in both
groups after surgery, as did all neutrophil activation markers, cytokines and chemokine.
PAD2 levels correlated with neutrophil activation markers, but not with cytokine and
chemokine levels.
Conclusion: Blood levels of PAD2 did not differ signiﬁcantly between smokers and non-
smokers, but smokers had decreased PAD activity in the circulation. PAD2 levels and
PAD activity increased in blood during inﬂammation induced by CABG with CPB. This
suggests that acute inﬂammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or a combination of these,
leads to systemic spreading of enzymatically active PAD, which may affect protein
function and induce generation of citrullinated self-antigens.

Introduction
Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) catalyzes the post-translational protein modiﬁcation
known as citrullination, which refers to the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline
residues. Citrullination can alter the function of several proteins, including cytokines and
chemokines,1,2 ﬁbrinogen,3 nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase4 and transforming growth

factor-β,5 and induce structural changes in proteins that gen-
erate autoantigenic neoepitopes, as observed in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and type I diabetes.6,7 The human PAD enzyme
family has ﬁve members (PADs 1–4 and 6), of which PAD2
and PAD4 are expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin, eg,
monocytes, lymphocytes and granulocytes.8 Neutrophils are
considered a major source of PAD2 and PAD4,9–11 and PAD
released from neutrophils is capable of citrullinating extracel-
lular proteins.10,12 Prerequisites for PAD activation are a high
calcium concentration, which is found in the extracellular
space,13 and a redox potential that maintains the catalytic site
in a reduced state.10,14 PAD and citrullinated proteins are
abundant in the lungs of smokers and are suspected to be the
initial source of citrullinated proteins that cause the anti-
citrulline immune response involved in RA.15–17 Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease18 and periodontitis19 are other
inﬂammatory conditions associated with
examples of
increased local levels of citrullinated proteins. Indeed, protein
citrullination appears to occur in inﬂammation in general.20
However, it is not known whether inﬂammation leads to
release of PAD into the bloodstream, which may potentially
cause citrullination of proteins in the circulation or at distant
anatomical sites, thereby generating antigens that ignite auto-
immune reactions.

is

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass
an example of
(CPB)
a circumstance where acute systemic inﬂammation occurs,
partly due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after aortic
unclamping leading to activation of endothelial cells and
neutrophils, and partly because neutrophils are activated
after contact with artiﬁcial surfaces of the cannula and
tubing connecting the patient to the CPB system.21–24

We investigate here whether smoking is associated
with increased levels of circulating PAD2 and PAD4, or
with increased PAD activity. Moreover, we examine
whether acute inﬂammation such as that
induced by
CABG surgery can lead to the release of enzymatically
active PAD into the systemic circulation.

Material and methods
Patient selection
The study included 36 patients with coronary heart disease
who underwent conventional elective CABG at
the
Department of Thoracic Surgery, Copenhagen University
Hospital Rigshospitalet. Patients below 18 years of age,
pregnant women, and patients with cancer, autoimmune dis-
orders or chronic inﬂammatory disorders were excluded.

Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The smokers
included (n=16) had all smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes
per day for at least 5 years and had smoked in the 48 hrs
before surgery. The non-smokers (n=20) had all smoked
<100 cigarettes ever. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee H-3-2014-164 and was per-
formed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and
all patients gave written informed consent.

antihypertensives

Preoperative medication
All patients had their aspirin and antiplatelet drugs paused
before the surgery. All patients were receiving treatment
antihypercholesterolemic
and
with
agents before the surgery. Patients with type 2 diabetes
were receiving treatment with either insulin or oral anti-
diabetics. One patient was receiving treatment with the
anti-inﬂammatory prednisolone (2.5 mg) before surgery.

Anesthesia
Anesthetic management was standardized. No premedica-
tion was given. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and
propofol infusion. Propofol, sevoﬂuran and remifentanil
were titrated thereafter. Cisatracurium was administered
before tracheal
intubation. Some patients were given
bolus CaCl and noradrenaline when coming off the CPB.
Corticosteroids were not used in any of the patients during
perioperative management. Cefuroxime (1.5 g) and genta-
micin (240 mg) were given perioperatively.

Surgical procedure
All CABG procedures were performed via a median ster-
notomy, and on-pump with CPB and extracorporeal circu-
lation (ECC). Patients were fully heparinized to maintain
an acquired coagulation time above 480 s. This effect was
reversed with protamine sulfate (1:1) after ﬁnalization of
ECC. Cardiac arrest was achieved with cold blood cardi-
oplegia, and ECC was performed under normothermia.
Standard anesthetic techniques were used, and intra-
operative monitoring was in accordance with guidelines.
Standard guidelines for anti-coagulation therapy were
followed.

Serum sampling
Blood samples were drawn 2 hrs before surgery and 2 hrs
after surgery (from the closure of the skin) in 6 mL dry
tubes (VACUETTE, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen,
Germany), from which serum was isolated.

Measurements of serum cytokines,
markers of neutrophil activation and PAD
Serum IL-6, IL-10 and CXCL-8 were measured using the
Cytometric Bead Array Human Inﬂammatory Cytokine Kit
II (Cat. no. 551811) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) after dilution of 5 µL serum in 20 µL PBS
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A FACS
Canto II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for
data acquisition, and the FCAPArray Software (SoftFlow,
Burnsville, MN, USA) was used for analysis. Neutrophil
activation markers were measured in serum diluted 1:50 in
sample diluent following the manufacturer’s instructions
using the Luminex Bio-Plex® 200 system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by means of the one-
plex myeloperodidase (MPO) assay (R&D, Abingdon,
UK), and the two-plex MMP-9 and lipocalin-2/NGAL
(R&D) assay. PAD2 was measured using an in-house PAD2-
speciﬁc assay on a Luminex platform.25 In brief, the murine
monoclonal anti-PAD2 antibody DN2 was coupled to beads,
and patient serum diluted 1:3 in sample buffer was added.
After washing, biotinylated anti-PAD2 antibody DN625 and

PE-labelled streptavidin were used for detection. CV% of
spiked controls were <15%. PAD4 was measured in undi-
luted serum using a commercially available ELISA kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (SEF709Hu
[N-terminal version], Cloud-Clone, TX, USA). Ability to
detect PAD4 speciﬁcally was conﬁrmed by spiking of
rhPAD2 or rhPAD4 into serum, but low recovery (<10%)
was observed.

ﬁbrinogen.13 In brief, Nunc ELISA plates (Roskilde,
Denmark) were coated with ﬁbrinogen (1.0 μg/mL). After
three washes, wells were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 mins at room temperature.
Serum was added (50 μL/well) and incubated for 4 hrs at RT,
with or without 1 mM DTT and/or 25 mM EDTA. After three
washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the wells were
incubated for 90 mins with 100 μL of murine anti-
citrullinated ﬁbrinogen antibody (clone 20B2, Modiquest,

Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare differences
between groups using GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-rank test was used to determine differences
before and after surgery. Spearman’s correlation (Rs)

coefﬁcients and levels of signiﬁcance were determined
using GraphPad Prism. Two-tailed probability values
<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Determination of circulating PAD2 and
PAD4 levels
We observed no signiﬁcant difference in PAD2 or PAD4 levels
between smokers and non-smokers before or after surgery
(Figure 1A, B, D, and E). The circulating PAD2 levels of

Catalytic activity of circulating PAD
We next tested whether the circulating PAD was enzy-
matically active and observed higher PAD activity in
serum from non-smokers than in serum from smokers
before surgery (Figure 2A), which we did not expect.
This difference was also present after surgery (Figure
2B). Since smoking has been reported to cause oxida-
tion of GSH and cysteine in the blood,26 we examined

whether PAD activity could be restored by addition of
DTT, an exogenous
reducing agent. PAD activity
increased in both groups after addition of DTT, but the
activity remained lower in smokers than in non-smokers
(Figure 2C). As illustrated in Figure 2D, CABG surgery
caused a marked increase in catalytic activity of circu-
lating PAD in nearly all patients tested, both for smo-
kers and non-smokers (p<0.001).

Effect of CABG surgery on inﬂammatory
mediators and neutrophil degranulation
To determine whether the increase in PAD2 levels and PAD
activity observed during CABG surgery reﬂected the state
of inﬂammation, we quantiﬁed circulating levels of the pro-
inﬂammatory cytokine IL-6, the anti-inﬂammatory cyto-
kine IL-10, and the chemokine CXCL-8 (Figure 3A–C).
The levels of all three molecules increased after surgery
(Figure 3A–C). To address the degree of neutrophil activa-
tion, we quantiﬁed MPO, MMP-9 and lipocalin-2, as mar-
kers of degranulation of the primary, secondary and tertiary
granules, respectively. The levels of all three markers were
elevated after surgery (Figure 3D–F).

Before surgery, the levels of PAD2 did not correlate
with any of the biomarkers, whereas a signiﬁcant corre-
lation was found between circulating PAD2 and MPO
levels after surgery (p=0.03; Table 2). After surgery, we
observed a trend toward correlation between PAD2 and
the two other markers of neutrophil activation, whereas
no association was observed with IL-6, IL-10 or CXCL-
8. When the basal levels of all six biomarkers before
surgery were subtracted from those observed after sur-
gery (shown as “ΔSurgery” in Table 2), the change in
circulating PAD2 levels correlated with the changes in
both MPO and lipocalin-2 levels, but not with the
change in IL-6,
IL-10 or CXCL-8. No associations
were observed between PAD4 and the six biomarkers
before or after surgery (data not shown).

with human ﬁbrinogen were incubated for 4 hrs with sera from 36 patients who had

Discussion
Citrullination alters the function and antigenicity of
many proteins2,4,27 and is thought
to play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases,
especially RA.7 Citrullination in this respect is thought
to occur at the very sites of PAD release, eg, in the
lungs, periodontal tissue or gut.15,19,28 In this study, we
put forward the hypothesis that PAD is released into the
circulation following smoking or acute inﬂammation.

PAD2 was present in detectable concentrations in the
blood from most patients before surgery, and was found to
be markedly increased after surgery. This was not the case
for PAD4 levels. We have previously found detectable
blood levels of PAD2 in less than a third of normal
blood donors,25 but to our knowledge, no other studies
have examined circulating PAD2 in relation to disease or
inﬂammation. Although smokers tended to have slightly

higher blood levels of PAD2 than non-smokers, there was
a great overlap between our groups. Increased amounts of
PAD2 along with increased numbers of macrophages have
previously been shown in the lungs of smokers.16,17 Our
data indicate that this PAD2 enters the bloodstream to only
a limited extent. This may be because it does not cross the
alveolar epithelium or is rapidly degraded locally. It is also

sufﬁciently stimulated for PAD release before blood sam-
pling in this study.

Importantly, the PAD contained in the serum samples
was enzymatically active in many cases. Thus, PAD
inﬂammation
released into the circulation during local
may citrullinate extracellular proteins, which potentially
modify their functional properties or render proteins anti-
genic. Surprisingly, we found that the PAD contained in
the blood of smokers was less active than that of non-
smokers. The PAD activity of serum from smokers could
be restored by addition of the reducing agent DTT, which
suggests that PAD is inactivated by oxidation in the blood
of smokers, presumably by reactive oxygen species
released as a consequence of smoking.26 It is possible
that circulating inactive PAD can be reactivated at anato-
mical sites with a reducing environment. Thus, PAD activ-
ity can be restored in synovial ﬂuid from RA patients after
addition of a reducing agent,10 but to our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst time that catalytic activity has been observed in
serum without addition of reducing agents.

The fact that only PAD2 levels increased during surgery
in this study suggests that PAD2 is predominantly responsi-
ble for the observed PAD activity in the blood. Neutrophils
are a predominant source of PAD2 and PAD4,9,10,12 and our
ﬁnding that the increase in PAD2 levels during surgery
correlated with the increase in neutrophil activation markers –
but not with changes in proinﬂammatory cytokines – is in
keeping with this. This agrees with previous ﬁndings that
extracellular activity of PAD released from neutrophils
in vitro is primarily mediated by PAD2.29 PAD2 is rapidly
released from neutrophils on stimulation,12 and with blood
sampling 2 hrs after surgery, it is likely that the PAD2
released during the surgical procedure was pre-formed rather
than synthesized de novo. The measurements of PAD4 in this
study should be interpreted with caution, however, since low
recovery was observed in the PAD4 ELISA after spiking of
PAD4 into serum.

CABG surgery is based on the use of the CPB, which is
known to induce ischemia, neutrophil activation, and
a systemic inﬂammatory response which exceeds that
observed after other major surgical procedures.21,23 We cannot
rule out that the neutrophil activation observed in this study and
any consequent PAD release were caused by sheer mechanical
stress or hypoxia. However, extracellular PAD activity is
observed as a consequence of inﬂammatory stimuli,30 so we
propose that PAD2 release and an increase in circulating PAD
activity are features of acute inﬂammation in a broader sense.
This remains to be tested in other inﬂammatory conditions.

Conclusion
PAD2 is released into circulation during CABG surgery
with CPB, and the PAD released is enzymatically active.
The increase in PAD2 levels correlated with an increase in
neutrophil activation markers, indicating that neutrophils
were the predominant source of PAD2. Smoking had no
statistically signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on circulating PAD2
levels, and the catalytic activity of circulating PAD was
unexpectedly decreased among smokers. The implications
of this remain to be investigated.

The inﬂammatory response is an adaptive mechanism that evolved to ﬁght against
infections and tissue damage. This complex mechanism is vital for the proper function of
the organism, and because of that, is under tight regulation involving a complex network
of factors, cells, and systems. Physiological inﬂammation is perfectly orchestrated to allow
the mobilization of leukocytes from the circulation to the injured tissues for the removal of
pathogens, tissue repair, and return to homeostasis. However, when the self-limited nature
of the inﬂammatory response and the mechanisms of resolution fail, inﬂammation might
become chronic, leading to the development of many disabling serious diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), or psoriasis.

Knowledge of the molecular and cellular processes underlying chronic inﬂammation
has substantially increased in recent decades. This resulted in enormous improvements in
the treatments for immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases, but also revealed the com-
plexity of the cytokine networks and immune cell subtypes involved in non-resolving
inﬂammatory responses. This fact could explain, in part, why certain groups of patients
are totally or partially refractory to current therapies. Therefore, we cannot be satisﬁed
with the available drugs, and more research focusing on deciphering the precise molecular
pathways behind uncontrolled inﬂammation is mandatory for developing novel therapeu-
tic approaches.

The 34 original and review articles included in this Special Issue contributed to the
aim of describing and understanding new mechanisms that trigger inﬂammation and
highlighted new putative treatments for different inﬂammatory conditions.

Neuroinﬂammation is a perfect example of the two faces of inﬂammation. While an
acute inﬂammatory response is protective, chronic neuroinﬂammation leads to inﬂamma-
tory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and it also contributes to other neurological [1]
and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease [2]. Microglia is piv-
otal for regulating central nervous system inﬂammation. Therefore, it would be interesting
to develop therapeutic strategies conducted to mitigate their hyperactivation. Following
that aim, Saliba et al. synthesized a new antagonist for the orphan G-protein coupled
receptor 55, which decreased the production of prostaglandin E2 and reduced the activation
of pro-inﬂammatory signalling pathways [3]. In line with this, other receptors regulating
microglia function are being explored. This is the case for some purinergic receptors such
as P2Y receptors, whose actions on microglia and neuroinﬂammation were elegantly re-
viewed by Gómez Morillas et al. [4]. These data highlight that the isolation of new receptors
that can be pharmaceutically targeted might be relevant for treating neuroinﬂammatory
disorders. Actually, a similar approach is followed for other immune-mediated patholo-
gies, in which the inhibition of various receptors such as sodium-glucose co-transporter
2 [5], angiotensin receptor [6], or toll-like receptors [7] is being tested for controlling the

exacerbated inﬂammatory response during acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection, heart
failure, etc.

Focusing on autoimmune responses, Amend et al. [8] and Carvalheiro et al. [9] in-
vestigated the effects of IL-10 and angiopoietin-2 in the context of lupus and systemic
sclerosis, respectively. The former shed light on the poorly understood role played by
IL-10 in the development of lupus, revealing that IL-10 outcome depends on the complex
interplay among the different immune cells and the inﬂammatory microenvironment. The
latter investigated, for the ﬁrst time, how angiopoietin-2 can increase the production of
pro-inﬂammatory mediators by monocytes from systemic sclerosis patients, which could
contribute to the development of ﬁbrotic processes in the skin of those patients. Fibrosis is
also a key feature in chronic kidney injury, and Leong et al. [10] functionally demonstrated
in experimental acute kidney injury mouse models that cyclophilin inhibition protects from
renal injury and ﬁbrosis, an observation that is accompanied by reduced innate immune
cell inﬁltration.

Inﬂammation signiﬁcantly contributes to skin malignancies, as reviewed by
Ansary et al. [11] and Razib Hossain et al. [12]. Interestingly, Yang et al. [13] demonstrated
in vitro and in vivo the therapeutic potential of the natural small molecule neferine as an
anti-inﬂammatory drug for atopic dermatitis. Moreover, Hathaway-Schrader et al. [14]
showed new insights for a better comprehension of the immune evasion in melanoma cells.
Historically, inﬂammation-related research mainly comprised studies related to im-
mune cells and inﬂammatory mediators. However, in recent years, more multidisciplinary
and integrative approaches have been applied for the dissection of the inﬂammatory pro-
cess [15]. This is the case for the article by Weiss et al. [16], which showed an interesting
view of the participation of histone deacetylases in the activation of pro-inﬂammatory
signalling cascades and mediators in cultured macrophages. Moreover, another work
explored the methylation status of speciﬁc promoters for their participation in neuronal
inﬂammatory diseases. Hypermethylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is
commonly observed in brain tumours. However, Teuber-Hanselmann et al. [17] reported
an original hypermethylation of that gene in inﬂammatory conditions affecting the central
nervous system. Likewise, the participation of adipokines and obesity in regulating in-
ﬂammation and cardiovascular disease [18,19] and the impact of the YAP/TAZ signalling
in the immunomodulatory responses of tumours [20] have also been discussed. Of note,
Götz et al. [21] demonstrated in vivo the relevance of the complement system in the recruit-
ment of neutrophils and M2-polarised macrophages to ischemic tissues, which, most likely,
are the most relevant players in the observed improvement of angiogenesis.

The impact of environmental factors such as pollutants, microparticles, or endocrine
disruptors is gaining interest. The latter is not only relevant for their interference with
the normal function of the endocrine system, but endocrine disruptors can also partici-
pate in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (as reviewed
by Cano et al.) by modulating liver metabolism [22]. In the same way, the food additive
titanium dioxide worsened experimental colitis in mice carrying IBD genetic risk muta-
tions [23], suggesting that the ingestion of industrial compounds can be detrimental to
patients with IBD with an increased genetic predisposition. Silicon dioxide is well-known
for causing lung silicosis, and novel pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment options
were reviewed by Adamcakova et al. [24]. Interestingly, Wang et al. [25] demonstrated the
efﬁcacy of a novel class of pharmacological compounds, namely SUL-151, in decreasing
neutrophilia after cigarette smoke exposure in mice.

This Special Issue also contains translational studies demonstrating the association
between high concentrations of IL-6 receptor antagonist and reduced carbohydrate dis-
orders and NAFLD progression in obese individuals [26], the impairment of circulating
monocytes and the aberrant production of pro-inﬂammatory mediators in spinal cord
injury patients [27], and the existence of a ﬁbroinﬂammatory signature in human follicular
ﬂuid of the female reproductive system [28]. Furthermore, Di Paola et al. [29] showed
the effects of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist Eltrombopag in the differentiation of

macrophages obtained from children with immune thrombocytopenia. Altogether, these
data show, in the human setting, how inﬂammation can also be at play in conditions not
typically recognised as immune-mediated diseases.

Finally, in this compilation of articles, we ﬁnd very interesting reviews updating a wide
variety of topics such as hypoalbuminemia as a surrogate of infections [30], the resolution
of inﬂammation in IBD or pain [31,32], the impact of inﬂammation in liver tumorigene-
sis and alcohol disease [33,34], and nutraceutical supplementation in obesity-associated
disorders [35]. Moreover, Rafael-Vidal et al. reviewed the potential use of calcineurin in-
hibitors to treat lupus nephritis [36], and the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating
osteoporosis after spinal cord injury were described by Shams et al. [37].

We hope the lectors will appreciate reading these papers. We thank all the authors and
reviewers for their dedication and proactive participation that made the realisation of this
remarkable Special Issue possible.

Introduction: Chronic inflammation is a pernicious underlying status, well-known for its contribution to the progressive development 
of various diseases. In this regard, Micro-immunotherapy (MI) might be a promising therapeutic strategy. MI employs low doses (LD) 
and ultra-low doses (ULD) of immune regulators in their formulations. In particular, as both IL-1β and TNF-α are often used at ULD 
in MI medicines (MIM), a special emphasis has been made on formulations that include these factors in their compositions.
Methods: Several in vitro models have been employed in order to assess the effects of two unitary MIM consisting of ULD of IL-1β 
and TNF-α (u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2, respectively), and four complex MIM (c-MIM-1, −2, −3 and −4) characterized by the presence of 
ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α amongst other factors. Thus, we first investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2 in 
a model of inflamed colon carcinoma cells. In addition, the anti-inflammatory potential of c-MIM-1, −2, −3 and −4, was assessed in 
in vitro models of intestinal and neuronal inflammation.
Results: The results revealed that u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2 both induced a slight decrease in the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α transcripts. 
Regarding the c-MIMs’ effects, c-MIM-1 displayed the capability to restore the altered transepithelial electrical resistance in inflamed- 
HCoEpiC cells. Moreover, c-MIM-1 also slightly increased the expression of the junction-related protein claudin-1, both at the mRNA 
and protein levels. In addition, our in vitro investigations on c-MIM-2 and c-MIM-3 revealed their immune-modulatory effects in LPS- 
inflamed human monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, on the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-α, PGE2, and IL-6. Finally, 
c-MIM-4 restored the cell viability of LPS/IFN-γ-inflamed rat cortical neurons, while reducing the secretion of TNF-α in rat glial cells.
Discussion: Our  results shed  the  light  on  the  potential role  of  these  MIM  formulations in  managing  several chronic  inflammation- 
related conditions.

Introduction
Inflammatory  mechanisms  are  part  of  the  normal  body’s  defense  against  aggressions,  however,  when  they  last  for 
prolonged periods of time (months to years), they can induce a chronic inflammatory state that can be detrimental to the 
organism.1 The etiology of such slow and long-lasting inflammation is very heterogeneous, as multiple causes can trigger 
an  over-activation  of  the  immune  system,  inhibiting  at  the  same  time  its  normal  return  to  homeostasis.  Besides  the 
context  of  auto-immune  disorders,  some  of  the  reasons  that  can  perpetuate  a  low-grade  inflammation  could  be:  (i)  the 
organism’s inability to eliminate infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses or parasites, (ii) its prolonged exposure to low

nutrition.  If  those  triggers  are  maintained  over  a  long  period  of  time,  they  can  lead  to  chronic  inflammatory-related 
diseases  that  can  involve  many  other  organs  and  tissue  of  the  body  like  the  gut,  driving  inflammatory  bowel  diseases 
(IBD);  the  cardio-vascular  system  (stroke,  atherosclerosis);  the  brain  (depression,  neurodegenerative  diseases);  the 
immune system (auto-immune diseases and cancer); the endocrine-metabolic system (diabetes and obesity).

Numerous treatment strategies have been employed in order to reduce inflammation and immunotherapies are one of 
them.  For  instance,  the  use  of  cytokine-based  therapies  has  been  reported  in  the  management  of  sepsis,  diabetes,  or 
cardiovascular  diseases  with  quite  promising  results.  However,  unwanted  side  effects  still  remain,  probably  due  to  the 
cytokines or immune factors dosages employed. A therapeutic approach that includes micro-immunotherapy (MI) could 
thus be of great interest in order to face such concerns. Indeed, MI medicines (MIM) are immune-factor-based medicines, 
which formulations either encompass a sole active substance (unitary preparations; referred to as u-MIM) or a distinctive 
combination of several ingredients (complex MIM; referred to as c-MIM). These medicines are manufactured in the form 
of sucrose-lactose pillules impregnated with the corresponding active ingredients, for oromucosal administration, and are 
intended  to  be  taken  in  a  fasted  state.  In  this  manner,  the  active  substances  can  reach  the  oral-pharyngeal  mucosal 
immune system,2 as well as the mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with their associated lymphoid 
tissues and cell populations of the innate and adaptative immune responses.3  This route of administration will, in turn, 
elicit systemic and local effects, as we could observe in previous published preclinical in vivo studies.4–6

Through their exclusive preparation, MIM aim at gently modulating the expression and the related signaling pathways 
of cytokines and immune factors by providing to the organism these molecules at low doses (LD) and ultra-low doses 
(ULD) (Figure 1). These LD/ULD are expressed in Hahnemannian dilution (CH) or in Korsakovian dilutions (K). LD of 
bioactive  molecules  (ranging  from  3  to  5  CH)  are  used  in  MI  formulations  to  mimic  the  low  doses  occurring  in  the 
organism,7,8 and are employed to induce their own biological effects, stimulating their functions (Figure 1, green part). The 
recently published preclinical study on the unitary interferon-γ (4 CH) indeed shows how, at cellular levels, the drug elicits 

Figure 1 General scheme of the concept of low doses (LD) and ultra-low doses (ULD) in the context of MI supported by the two cited preclinical research studies referring 
to the immune-stimulatory/anti-inflammatory responses elicited by the LD or ULD, respectively. LD of cytokines, ranging from 3 centesimal Hahnemannian (CH) to 5 CH, 
aim at orienting the immune responses towards an immune stimulation, inducing their own biological effect through mimicking the physiological low doses employed in the 
body. The immune-stimulatory effects of IFN-γ (4 CH) have been reported by Jacques et al 2022.7 On the other side of the spectrum, ULD aim at modulating (from 6 CH)/ 
down-regulating  (from  12  CH  and  beyond)  a  response.  For  instance,  the  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  employed  at  27  CH,  exerted  anti-inflammatory 
responses (Floris et al 2020).9 The CH numbers represented on the x-axis are the ones employed in the MIM’s formulations studied in the current manuscript. The arrows

immunostimulatory and co-stimulatory effects on different cell types.7 On the other side, the use of ULD (from 6 CH up to 
30  CH)  employed  in  MI  is  intended  to  modulate  (from  6  CH)  and/or  down-regulate  (from  12  CH  and  beyond)  the 
expression of the concerned active substances (Figure 1, orange part). Interestingly, we previously reported that the two 
unitary medicines (u-MIM) interleukin (IL) 1β (IL-1β) (27 CH) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (27 CH) displayed 
anti-inflammatory properties, as they both exhibit the potential to inhibit the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α, in a model of 
human  primary monocytes as  well as in  THP-1 cells, after  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure (Figure 2A, blue box).9 

Figure 2 (A) The rationale of the present study is based on the fact that ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α are employed in the tested MI medicines (MIM). The anti-inflammatory 
role of these cytokines, when used at 27 CH, under the respective form of unitary MIM (u-MIM) has been reported by Floris et al 2020,9 and Jacques et al 2021,11 in a model 
of inflamed-immune cells (blue box) consisting of LPS-inflamed human primary monocytes and THP-1 cells. In the current study, the effects of these u-MIM were appraised in 
an intestinal model of inflammation (red box; see Results Section 1., for the results). (B) Scheme recapitulating the overall organization of the present manuscript regarding

Moreover, other in vitro and in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of a MI formula-
tion employing ULD of TNF-α and IL-1β in association with other immune regulators,4,10,11 providing encouraging results 
about the potential of some MIM in slowing down the pro-inflammatory responses in the context of chronic inflammation. 
Based on these previous results, the first aim of this study was to assess the effects of these two ULD-based u-MIMs in 
another specific inflammatory context, an intestinal inflammation model (Figure 2A, red box).

In  contrast  to  unitary  preparations,  complex  MI  formulations  consist  of  a  unique  association  of  active  substances, 
thought to act synergistically in order to coherently channel a specific biological response. The second aim of this study 
was to conduct a complementary assessment of the effects of four c-MIM (referred to as c-MIM-1, c-MIM-2, c-MIM-3 
and c-MIM-4 in this manuscript), as they all employ ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α in their formulations, in association with 
additional  actives  at  LD/ULD.  c-MIM-1  also  includes  ULD  of  IL-8  and  LD  of  IL-10;  c-MIM-2  includes  ULD  of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-6, with LD of IL-10, too; c-MIM-3 uses ULD of IL-6, IL-13 and oncostatin M (OSM), 
as well as LD of tumor growth factor β (TGF-β) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Finally, c-MIM-4 employs ULD 
of IL-6 and IL-12 as well as LD of IL-4 (Figure 2B).

It  is  now  well-recognized  that  chronic  inflammation  triggers  a  whole-body  response  and  the  activation  of  many 
feedback loops with interconnected effects.12  Moreover, as an integrated and complex system, the different anatomical 
parts of the body communicate between them. Considering the particularly close relationship between the epithelial cells 
from the gut, the immunity and the nervous system,13  the main purpose of this study was indeed to assess the potential 
anti-inflammatory  properties  of  four  different  complex  MIM’s  (c-MIM)  formulations  in  several  inflammatory  contexts 
related to the (i) -intestinal tract (Figure 2B, red box), (ii) -immune axis (Figure 2B, blue box) and (iii) -nervous system 
(Figure 2B, yellow box), depending on their specific cytokines combination. The further paragraphs of this introduction 
will  provide  brief  non-exhaustive  detail  about  the  role  of  each  cytokine  in  the  three  above-mentioned  contexts,  thus 
explaining the deliberate choice to assess each c-MIM in a particular inflammatory model in the first place.

Recent literature delineated the importance of IL-8 and IL-10 in the molecular mechanisms driving GI inflammatory 
diseases.14,15 The fact that c-MIM-1 includes ULD of IL-8 and LD of IL-10 in its formulation thus motivated the choice 
of assessing the cellular effects of this medicine in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation (Figure 2B, red box).

In a more general approach, c-MIM-2 and c-MIM-3 have been investigated in vitro, on the immune axis in different 
cell types and inflamed experimental contexts (Figure 2B, blue box). These two formulations employ ULD of IL-1β and 
TNF-α in association with ULD of PGE2, or ULD of IL-6, IL-13, and OSM, and LD of IL-10, or LD of TGF-β and IL- 
1Ra. Numerous publications, nicely put together in the review from Tsuge et al indeed reported the major role played by 
PGE2 in the mediation of inflammation and immune diseases, notably through its implication in mechanisms related to 
Th1 differentiation, and Th1/Th17/Th22 signaling.16  In the context of immunity, IL-10 is produced by a broad type of 
myeloid  and  lymphoid  cells  during  infections,  and  suppresses  macrophages  and  dendritic  cells  functions,  thereby 
impeding Th1 and  Th2  effector responses.17  In  immune effector cell types, and  in a wide  range of  established models 
of chronic inflammation, IL-10 is reported to play a central role in the regulation of homeostasis.18 On another side, TGF- 
β is  important  in  maintaining the  T cell  tolerance to  self  or  innocuous  environmental  antigens.19  IL-1 is  known  for  its 
crucial  involvement  in  the  onset  and/or  the  etiopathogenesis  of  several  inflammatory-mediated  diseases.  Given  its 
importance,  several  therapeutic  approaches  consisting  of  the  use  of  IL-Ra  have  been  used  in  clinical  practice  to  block 
the activity of IL-1.20  OSM is a pleiotropic cytokine playing important roles  in a wide range of homeostatic functions 
(such as hematopoiesis, bone/fat turnover, liver regeneration) and, under chronic inflammatory diseases, it may play pro- 
inflammatory  roles,  depending  on  the  microenvironment  and  the  interested  tissue,  without  being  overexpressed  at 
systemic  levels.21  IL-6  is  also  a  pleiotropic  cytokine  playing  important  roles  in  hematopoiesis,  bone  metabolism 
embryonic  development,  immunity,  and  host  responses.  Its  expression  is  finely  regulated  at  multiple  levels,  and  when 
a dysregulated and persistent IL-6 expression occurs, it may lead to the development of various inflammatory-mediated 
diseases.22,23  Similarly,  IL-13  is  known  to  exert  pleiotropic  effects  and  to  be  involved  in  inflammatory-mediated 
diseases.24

Finally, in the case of c-MIM-4, which employs ULD of both IL-6 and IL-12 in its formulation, as well as IL-4 at LD, 
one  of  the  goals  of  this  study  was  to  assess  its  effects  using  an  in  vitro  preclinical  model  of  neuronal  inflammation 
(Figure 2B, yellow box). The rationale behind the choice of the neuronal-inflammation context was supported by a rich

bibliography,  illustrated  by  the  following  examples.  For  instance,  according  to  the  results  of  a  recent  meta-analysis, 
patients suffering from depressive symptoms express higher levels of IL-6.25  Another study also reported that the IL-12 
serum  levels  of  patients  with  major  depression  were  significantly  higher  than  healthy  controls,  and  that  an  8-weeks 
treatment led to a reduction of these levels.26 On the other hand, it was suggested that IL-4 could modulate IL-1β-induced 
depressive behavior in rats, by inhibiting IL-1β-induced central glial activation and neurotransmitter alterations.27

Materials and Methods
Tested Item and Experimental Control
The tested MIMs are homeopathic medicinal products consisting of sucrose-lactose pillules impregnated with ethanolic 
preparations  of  cytokines.  These MIMs  were  manufactured  by  Labo’Life  España,  as  previously  described,6,7  and  have 
been provided for investigational purposes. The two u-MIM under investigation in this study (referred as u-MIM-1 and 
u-MIM-2)  are  presented  as  unitary  medicines,  while  the  four  tested  complex  capsules  (c-MIM-1,  c-MIM-2,  c-MIM-3, 
and  c-MIM-4)  are  made  of  a  specific  combination  of  either  four,  five  or  seven  different  ingredients  (Figure  2).  Their 
composition is characterized by cytokines and immune factors and their amount is expressed in CH or in K.

The  Veh.  pillules  used  in  the  study  as  controls  are  manufactured  by  Labo’Life  Belgium.  Previous  publications 
described how these vehicle controls are produced, in order to provide a suitable control for preclinical research.4,6,7,9,10 
Regarding  the  in  vitro  experiments  performed  in  the  current  study,  u-MIM,  c-MIM  or  the  Veh.  pillules  were  freshly 
diluted in 100 mL of culture medium to reach the final sucrose-lactose concentration of 11 mM.

Cell Lines
HT-29- cells, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line with epithelial morphology was used in this study. This cell 
line  was  purchased  from  the  ATCC  (ATCC®  HTB-38™,  Molsheim,  France)  and  was  grown  in  Dulbecco’s  Modified 
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with high glucose (4.5 g/L) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (DMEM 10% FCS, PAA 
Laboratories,  Les  Mureaux,  France)  and  antibiotics  (streptomycin  100  μg/mL  and  penicillin  100  units/mL,  Sigma 
Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2  and 95% relative humidity.

To  induce  inflammatory  conditions,  a  pre-stimulation  of  cells  by  TNF-α  (ref  #  39–8329-60/E08250-1633, 
eBioscience) at 10 ng/mL was performed for 3 hours. The tested Veh. and MIMs were then added to the culture medium 
containing  the  TNF-α  for  24  more  hours  before  an  extensive  wash,  and  harvested  for  mRNA  extraction.  Supernatants 
(SN) were collected to perform cytokine quantification by ELISA.

Evaluation of Gene Expression by RT-qPCR
Total  mRNA was  isolated  from  cells  using  Rneasy  kit  (Macherey  Nagel,  Hoerdt,  France)  according  to  the  manufac-
turer’s instructions. RNA quantification was performed using spectrophotometry. After treatment  at 37°C for 30  min 
with  20–50  units  of  RNase-free  DNase  I  (Roche  Diagnostics  Corporation,  Indianapolis,  IN,  USA),  oligo-dT  primers 
(Roche  Diagnostics  Corporation,  Indianapolis,  USA),  the  High-Capacity  cDNA  Reverse  Transcription  Kit  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Waltham,  MA,  USA)  was  used  to  synthesize  single-stranded  cDNA.  The  mRNA was  quantified  using 
SYBR  green  Master  Mix  (Applera,  Courtaboeuf,  France)  with  human-specific  oligonucleotides  in  a  GeneAmp 
Abiprism 7000 (Applera). In each assay, calibrated and no-template controls were included. Each sample was run in 
triplicate.  SYBR  green  dye  intensity  was  analyzed  using  the  Abiprism  7000  SDS  software  (Applera,  Courtaboeuf, 
France). All results were normalized to the unaffected housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH).

All the results are expressed as a fold of the mean of activation of duplicate/mean of duplicate in medium alone or 
TNF-α alone. The primers sequences used are the following: GAPDH: Forward (F): 5’-GAC ACC CAC TCC TCC ACC 
TTT-3’;  Reverse  (R):  5’-TTG  CTG  TAG  CCA  AAT  TCG  TTG  T-3’;  TNF-α:  F:5’-CAG  GAC  GTG  GAG  CTG  GCC

Inflamed Colon Epithelial Intestinal Cells Model
Phytohemagglutinin-Stimulated Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell’ Supernatants Production
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adult volunteer donors were isolated by centrifugation 
of  venous  blood  on  Ficoll-Hypaque  density  gradients  (Amersham  Pharmacia  Biotech,  Piscataway,  NJ,  USA).  Healthy 
volunteers were enrolled by the Blood Bank Center (Etablissement Français du Sang, EFS, Pays de Loire, France). All 
blood  samples  were  approved  by  the  Ethics  committee  of  the  EFS  Blood  Bank  Center  with  written  informed  consent 
obtained  for  all  the  donors,  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki.  Cells  (105/mL)  were  cultured  in  24-well 
round-bottom  plates  in  2  mL  of  complete  medium  and  stimulated  with  phytohemagglutinin  (PHA)  (5  µg/mL)  for  48 
hours. The SN were collected and stored at −80°C until use.

Trans-Epithelial Resistance Assessment in Human Colonic Epithelial Cells
Human Colonic Epithelial Cells (HCoEpiC) were purchased from Innoprot, Bizkaia, Spain. The cells were seeded at the 
density of 5×105 cells in 24-well plate inserts whose diameter is 6.5 mm and the membrane area 0.3 cm2 and grown until 
tight confluence. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. 
The  trans-epithelial  resistance  (TEER)  measurements  were  obtained  as  Ω/cm2  and  performed  with  a  Millicell®  ERS-2 
device  at  different  incubation  times  (24  hours  and  72  hours),  in  the  presence/absence  of  the  PBMC  SN,  with/without 
c-MIM-4  or  Veh.  added  30  minutes  before  reading.  The  measurements  were  performed  in  HBSS  without  phenol  red 
(Sigma-Aldrich, ref # H6648), adding 600 µL HBSS in the basolateral area and 100 µL of HBSS in the apical area for 30 
minutes.  After  this  time,  readings  in  3  individual  wells  (n  =  3)  were  made.  10  mM  of  sodium  caprate  (C10)  (Sigma- 
Aldrich, ref # C4151) was used as a positive control.

Claudin-1 Expression Assessment in Human Colonic Epithelial Cells
HCoEpiC cells were seeded at a density of 500.000 cells/well in 6 well plates and grown until confluence. HCoEpiC cells 
were treated with or without Veh. or c-MIM-1 for 24 h. After that, 400 μL of human PBMC SN previously activated with 
PHA during 48 h was added to each well for 30 minutes. After treatments, the cells were collected and divided into two 
parts, one part was used for mRNA isolation and the other part for protein extraction.

Evaluation of the Claudin-1 Expression by Real-Time qPCR
For  quantitative  reverse  transcriptase-PCR  assays,  total  RNA  (1  µg)  was  retrotranscribed  using  the  iScript  cDNA

Evaluation of the Claudin-1 Expression by Western Blot
The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and proteins were extracted in 50 μL of lysis buffer (50 mM 
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% NP-40) supplemented with 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ 
mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL pepstatin and aprotinin, and 1 μL/mL phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) saturated. Twenty  
micrograms of protein were boiled at 95°C in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed in 10% SDS/PAGE gels. Separated 
proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (20V for 30 min) and blocked in tris-buffered 
saline  (TBS)  solution  containing  0.1%  Tween  20  and  5%  non-fat  dry  milk  for  1 hour  at  room  temperature. 
Immunodetection of specific proteins was carried out by incubation with a primary antibody rabbit anti-Cldn-1 (1:200, 
Ref: #ab15098, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and β-actin (1:10.000 dilution, Ref: #A5316, Sigma), overnight, at 4°C. After 
washing  membranes,  horseradish  peroxidase-conjugated  secondary  antibody  was  added  and  detected  by 
a  chemiluminescence  system  (GE  Healthcare  Europe  GmbH,  Freiburg,  Germany).  The  quantification  of  the  Blot’s 
pictures, was performed thanks to the online version of the ImageJ software (downloaded on the 2nd of May 2022).

Immunomodulation in Immune Cells
Immunomodulation in Human Monocytes
Human primary monocytes were prepared from buffy coats of three healthy human blood donors. All blood samples were 
approved  by  the  Ethics  committee  of  the  EFS  Blood  Bank  Center  with  written  informed  consent  obtained  for  all  the 
donors.  Cells  were  seeded  in  24-well  plates  at  a  density  of  2.200.000  cells/well  for  ELISA  measurements.  Monocytes 
were incubated with LPS (10 ng/mL, Salmonella typhimurium SL1181) for 30 min before treatment with either the Veh., 
or c-MIM-2 for an additional 24 hours. After 24 hours, SN were collected, centrifuged, and investigated for IL-1β, TNF- 
α and PGE2 concentrations in ELISA using the manufacturer’s protocol (n = 6, 3 different donors).

Immunomodulation in Human Macrophages
Human  CD14+  monocytes  were  isolated  from  the  blood  of  a  healthy  donor  (67  years  old  man).  The  blood  sample 
collection was approved by the Ethics committee of the EFS Blood Bank Center. After the mononuclear cells’ isolation 
by  the  Ficoll  gradient  centrifugation  method,  the  CD14+  cells  were  selected  by  positive  selection  thanks  to  magnetic 
beads (MACS®  Miltenyi Biotec B.V. and Co. KG, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Monocytes were then cultivated for 6 
days  in  24-well  plates,  with  α-MEM  medium  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS)  and  100  ng/mL 
macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  (M-CSF)  (R&D  Systems,  Inc.,  Minneapolis,  MN,  USA,  Ref:  #216-MC).  After 
these 6 days in culture, the medium was replaced with α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 ng/mL M-CSF in 
addition to 100 ng/mL LPS (Sigma, Ref: #L4391) and either the Veh. or c-MIM-3. The treatments were applied for 24 
hours and each condition was performed in triplicate. At the end of the incubation period, SN were collected, aliquoted, 
and  stored  at  −80°C  until  ELISA  assay  (human  IL-6  Quantikine,  R&D  Systems).  Optic  density  was  measured  on 
a  spectrophotometer  Multiskan  Go  and  the  Skanlt  3.2  software  was  used  to  quantify  the  measured  cytokine 
concentrations.

Immunomodulation in Human Granulocytes
Human primary granulocytes were freshly isolated from the blood of a healthy donor obtained from the EFS, and seeded 
in 48-well plates in optimized RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated FBS. Cells were then pre-incubated with 
either  Veh.,  or  c-MIM-3  for  one  hour,  before  the  addition  of  LPS  (1  µg/mL)  as  the  inflammation  inducer  within  the 
media. Cells were then incubated for 18 hours in presence of the tested items and LPS. All the experimental conditions 
were  performed  in  triplicate.  At  the  end  of  the  total  incubation  period,  SN  were  collected  and  the  assessed  cytokines 
levels  were  evaluated.  The  IL-6  and  IL-1β  levels  were  evaluated  by  multiplex  CBATM  method  following  the  provider 
recommendations  (Human  IL-6  Flex  Set;  BDTM  Biosciences,  A7  beads,  Ref:  #558276;  dilution  factor  1:5  and  Human 
IL-1β Flex Set; BDTM  Biosciences, B4 beads, Ref: #558279).

Immunomodulation in Neurons
Ethics Statement
All  animal  procedures  were  carried  out  in  strict  adherence  to  the  European  Community  Council  Directive  of 
September  22,  2010  (2010/63/UE).  All  experiments  and  protocols  were  authorized  and  approved  by  the  French 
Ministry  of  Research,  as  well  as  by  the  Animal  Welfare  Committees  of  Amylgen,  Biotrial,  QPS  and  Neuronexperts. 
All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used.

Cortical Neurons Culture
Rat cortical neurons were cultured as described by Singer et al28  Briefly, a pregnant female rat of 15 days gestation was 
sacrificed by CO2  inhalation (Wistar; Janvier Lab, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and the fetuses were removed from the 
uterus.  The  cortexes  were  removed  and  placed  in  ice-cold  medium  of  Leibovitz  (L15,  Panbiotech  GmbH,  Aidenbach, 
Germany, Ref: #P04-27055 batch: 8940719) containing 2% of penicillin/streptomycin (PS, PanBiotech Ref: #P06-07100, 
batch:  2791019)  and  bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA,  Panbiotech  Ref:  #P06-1391100,  batch:  H190110).  Cortexes  were 
dissociated  by  trypsin-EDTA  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Illkirch-Graffenstaden,  France  Ref:  #25300-054,  batch: 
2027082)  for  20  min  at  37°C.  The  reaction  was  stopped  by  the  addition  of  DMEM  (Panbiotech  Ref:  #P04-03600, 
batch:1220919) containing DNAase I grade II (0.1 mg/mL; PanBiotech, Ref: #P60-37780100, batch: H181015) and 10%

FCS (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Ref: #10270106, batch: 42G2082K). Cells were then mechanically dissociated by 
3 passages through a 10 mL pipette. Cells were then centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The SN was discarded and 
the cell pellet was re-suspended in a culture medium for neurons consisting of Neurobasal (Invitrogen, Ref: #11570556, 
batch:  2161553)  supplemented  with  2%  of  B27  (Invitrogen,  Ref:  #11530536,  batch:  2181375),  2  mM  of  L-glutamine 
(L-glut; PanBiotech, Ref: #P04-80100, batch: 1640518), 2% of PS solution, 1% of FCS and 10 ng/mL of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF, Peprotech France, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Ref #450-02, batch 31961). Viable cells were 
counted in a Neubauer cytometer using the trypan blue exclusion test. The cells were seeded at a density of 30.000 cells/ 
well  in  96  well-plates  (Falcon,  ref:  353072)  pre-coated  with  poly-D-lysine  (10  µg/mL;  Sigma,  ref:  P7886,  batch: 
SLBS8705) in H2O culture (PanBiotech ref: P04-991000, batch: 2900219) and were cultured at 37°C in a humidified air 
(95%)/CO2  (5%) atmosphere.

Preparation of Astrocytes and Microglial Cell and Culture with Cortical Neurons
One vial of rat glial cells (4.000.000 cells by vial at passage 2) was thawed and cells were seeded at the density of 12.000 
cells per cm² on 75 cm² flask (Nunc ref: 055403) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM of L-glutamine, 2% of PS solution 
and 10% of FCS. After 5 days of culture, the mix of astrocytes/microglial cells was dissociated by trypsin-EDTA for 20 
min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DMEM, containing DNAase I grade II (0.1 mg/mL) and 10% 
FCS. Cells were then centrifuged at 290 × g for 10 min at 4°C temperature. The cell pellet was re-suspended in a culture 
medium for neurons. Glial cells were seeded at the same time as the neurons at a density of 20.000 cells per well.

Compound Incubation and LPS/IFN-γ Treatment
After  8  days  of  coculture,  cells  were  treated  with  either  Veh.,  c-MIM-2,  or  MK801  (Sigma  ref:  M107,  batch: 
105M4606V)  at  20  µM  in  medium  for  neurons.  After  9  days  of  coculture,  cells  were  treated  with  or  without  the 
combination of LPS (100 ng/mL, Sigma ref: L2630, batch: 089M4016V)/IFN-γ (10 ng/mL, Peprotech ref: 315–05, batch: 
061798) during 24 hours,29–31  and with or without the tested items or MK801 in 300 µL of medium for neuron. At the 
end of this 24 hours incubation, SN were recovered and frozen for quantification of TNF-α released. Cortical neurons and 
glial cells were incubated in a medium for neurons with and without the tested items for an additional 48 hours to analyze 
the survival of neurons. Six independent wells were done per culture condition.

Quantification of Neuronal Cells Survival After Glial Cells LPS/INF-γ Activation
After 72 hours of glial cells LPS/INF-γ activation, cells were fixed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, ref: 
6148, batch: SZBE2390V) for 20 min at room temperature, and control conditions were also fixed according to the same 
procedure. The cells were then permeabilized and non-specific sites were blocked with a solution of PBS (PanBiotech; 
ref: P04-36500, batch: 5081219) containing 0.1% of saponin (Sigma; ref: S7900, batch: BCBL8667V) and 1% FCS for 
15  min  at  room  temperature.  Cells  were  incubated  overnight  at  4°C,  with  a  monoclonal  anti-microtubule  associated 
protein  2  antibodies  produced  in  mice  (MAP-2,  1/5000,  Sigma;  ref:  M4403,  batch:  063M4802),  in  a  solution  of  PBS 
containing 1%  FCS  and 0.1% saponin.  Antibody against  MAP-2 stains specifically  neuron cell  body and  neurite. This 
antibody  was  revealed  with  an  Alexa  Fluor  488  goat  anti-mouse  IgG  (1/400,  Molecular  probe,  ref:  A11001,  batch: 
2140660)  in  PBS  with  1%  FCS  and  0.1%  saponin,  for  1  hour,  at  room  temperature.  Nuclei  of  cells  were  labeled  by 
a fluorescent marker (Hoechst solution, Sigma; ref: B1155, batch: 046M4048V) in the same solution. For each condition, 
20  pictures  per  well  were  taken  using  InCell  Analyzer  2200  (GE  Healthcare)  with  20x  magnification.  Images  of  each 
culture well were taken in the same conditions. Analysis of cell bodies of MAP-2 positive neurons was performed using 
Developer  software  (GE  Healthcare).  A  total  of  6  data  per  experimental  condition  were  provided.  All  values  are 
expressed as mean ± s.e.m.

Quantification of Cytokine Release by ELISA
The  culture  SN  were  thawed  and  100  µL  by  well  were  used  to  quantified  by  ELISA  the  level  of  TNF-α  (TNF-α  rat 
ELISA  kit,  Fisher  Scientific,  ref:  KRC3011,  batch  218247–002)  released  by  glial  cells  in  the  media,  according  to  the 
manufacturer’s instructions. All values are expressed as mean ± SD.

Statistical Analysis
The graphs in the figures were performed with GraphPad Prism, Version 9.4 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San 
Diego California USA, updated on 16/06/2022). Authors have followed the recent recommendations of D.L. Vaux that 
encourage performing descriptive statistics instead to make statistical inferences when the number of independent values 
is small.32 Indeed, no statistical inference has been performed to analyze the results of the in vitro studies presented here.

Results
IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH), Both Unitary Micro-Immunotherapy Medicines, 
Slightly Reduced the Expression of IL-1β and TNF-α at Transcriptional Levels in TNF- 
α-Inflamed HT-29 Cells
Previous  results  reported  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  the  u-MIM  IL-1β  (27  CH)  and  TNF-α  (27  CH)  in  human 
primary monocytes and in the THP-1 cell line.9 In this study, we wanted to assess the effect of these unitaries in a model 
of intestinal inflammation, by using a human epithelial colon cancer cell line exposed to TNF-α. Therefore, the effect of 
IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH) was evaluated in HT-29 cells, inflamed by a 3 hours pre-incubation with 10 ng/mL 
TNF-α (Figure 3A). The cells were then treated with either the vehicle (Veh.), IL-1β (27 CH) or TNF-α (27 CH) for 24 
hours  before  assessing  the  transcripts’  expression  of  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  by  RT-qPCR.  The  results  are  presented  in 

Figure 3 IL-1β (27 CH) and TNF-α (27 CH) tend to decrease the expression of both IL-1β and TNF-α at transcriptional levels, in a model of intestinal inflammation. (A) 
Representative scheme of the experimental protocol. HT-29 cells were pre-treated for 3 hours with 10 ng/mL TNF-α as an inflammatory trigger before the incubation with

Figure  3B  and  C,  and  the  control  (Ct)  conditions  showed  that  the  mRNA  expression  of  both  of  the  cytokines  was 
increased  after  TNF-α  stimulation  (Figure  3,  white  vs  red  histograms).  A  decrease  of  more  than  two-fold  in  IL-1β 
expression was obtained after IL-1β (27 CH) treatment compared with the Veh. (Figure 3, grey vs orange histograms). In 
addition,  a  decrease  in  TNF-α  expression  of  about  two-fold  too  was  also  observed  in  the  same  treatment  conditions. 
Similar  response  patterns  towards  a  down-regulation  were  observed  after  treatment  with  the  other  u-MIM,  TNF-α  (27 
CH)  (Figure  3,  grey  vs  yellow  histograms).  Considering  these  interesting  trends,  the  following  sections  of  this  study 
aimed  at  evaluating  the  anti-inflammatory  properties  of  several  complex  MIM-containing  ULD  of  IL-1β  and  TNF-α 
within their formulations.

c-MIM-1 Could Restore the Transepithelial Resistance in a Cellular Model of Intestinal 
Inflammation
The  integrity  of  the  intestinal  barrier  is  fundamental  to  maintain  healthy  gut  homeostasis,  as  well  as  physiological 
intestinal permeability. It is widely known that, under chronic inflammation, intestinal homeostasis is altered, resulting in 
an impairment of the barrier functions and thus, an increase in intestinal permeability.33  In order to induce an intestinal 
inflammation status in vitro, human HCoEpiC cells were exposed to supernatants (SN) derived from phytohemagglutinin 
(PHA)-treated PBMCs, which have been reported to be concentrated in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8 
and IL-17.34  The resistance of the epithelial barrier is one of the characteristics that reflects the intestinal permeability 
and the interactions’ strength between epithelial cells. As a consequence, any disruption within these epithelial interac-
tions  ultimately  creates  a  so-called  “leakage”  in  the  barrier,  leading  to  the  symptoms  related  to  inflammatory  bowel 
diseases.  Transepithelial  electrical  resistance  (TEER)  measurements,  expressed  in  Ω/cm,2  were  performed  with  a  -
Millicell®  ERS-2  device,  after  either  a  24-hours  or  a  72-hours  incubation  period,  with/without  PHA-treated-PBMCs 
SN, with/without either the Veh. or c-MIM-1, added 30 minutes before the SN (Figure 4A). 10 mM of sodium caprate 
(C10)  was  used  as  a  positive  inducer  of  the  epithelial  barrier  disruption  and  served  as  an  internal  control  attesting  the 
relevance of the model. The results in presence of PHA-treated PBMCs SN incubated for 24 and 72 hours are presented 
in Figure 4B and C, respectively.

As expected, the C10 stimulation alone decreased the TEER compared with the untreated control (Figure 4B and C, 
red histograms vs white  histograms). Similarly,  SN from PBMCs activated  with PHA, also  led to a  decrease in TEER 
compared with the untreated HCoEpiC cells (Figure 4B and C, orange histograms vs white histograms), thus confirming 
here the relevance of these SN as a pro-inflammatory stimulus.

Interestingly,  c-MIM-1  protected  the  epithelial  cells  against  the  PHA-stimulated  PBMCs  SN-induced  disruption 
(Figure  4B,  pink  histogram  vs  yellow  histogram),  after  24  hours.  Regarding  the  TEER  results  obtained  at  72  hours, 
c-MIM-1  effects  appear  to  be  transient,  as  these  protective  effects,  almost  disappeared  (Figure  4C  pink  histogram  vs 
yellow  histogram).  The  results  derived  from  three  independent  experiments  provide  for  the  first  time,  indications  of 
a potential effect of the c-MIM-1 formulation towards the protection of the epithelial barrier in an inflammatory context 
in vitro.

The  effect  of  c-MIM-1  was  assessed  in  human  HCoEpiC  cells  in  absence  of  inflammation,  too.  As  shown  in 
Supplementary  Figure  S1,  c-MIM-1  does  not  alter  the  barrier  permeability  compared  to  the  control  (Ct),  rather  it 
seems  that  c-MIM-1  has  restored  the  resistance  and  has  strengthened  the  epithelial  barrier  at  24  hours  in  comparison 
with the Veh., which has induced a small TEER decrease.

c-MIM-1 Slightly Increased Claudin-1 Expression in a Cellular Model of Intestinal 
Inflammation
In  light  of  the  previous  encouraging  results,  we  wanted  to  investigate  if  the  tested  medicine  could  modulate  the 
expression  of  one  of  the  proteins  present  within  the  tight  junctions,  involved  in  the  regulation  of  the  epithelial  barrier 
permeability. Indeed, claudin-1 is widely expressed in the intestinal epithelium and plays an important role in maintain-
ing intestinal barrier integrity.35  Briefly, HCoEpiC cells were treated with either the Veh. or c-MIM-1 for 24 hours, and 
SN from PHA-treated PBMCs were then added for an additional 30 minutes incubation. The cells were then harvested

Figure  4  C-MIM-1  displays  a  protective  effect  against  intestinal  permeability  in  a  model  of  intestinal  cells  inflamed  with  phytohemagglutinin  (PHA)-stimulated  PBMCs 
supernatants (SN). (A) Representative scheme of the experimental protocol. In the upper panel, the production of the PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) supernatants (SN) is illustrated. The lower panel shows the evaluation of the effect of c-MIM-1 on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in a model of 
HCoEpiC cells. FCS, fetal calf serum; HBSS, Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Briefly, PBMCs from healthy adult volunteers’ donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density 
gradients and the cells were seeded in 24-well round-bottom plates and stimulated with PHA (5 µg/mL) for 48 hours. At the end of the incubation period, the SN containing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines were harvested. In parallel, HCoEpiC cells were grown in 24-well plate inserts until tight confluence. Cells were either not treated (Ct), treated 
with Veh. or treated with c-MIM-1 for 30 min before media replacement with either regular DMEM media or PHA-stimulated PBMCs SN during the next 24 hours or 72 
hours. 30 minutes before the TEER measurement, the media was replaced with HBSS without phenol red alone in the basolateral area, in the apical chamber. Each condition 
has been measured in 3 individual wells (n = 3) and a condition in which C10 alone was incubated was used as a positive control for the induction of the epithelial disruption.

presented  in  Figure  5A  and  the  results  from  the  Western  Blots  are  illustrated  in  Figure  5B.  Overall,  in  inflammatory 
conditions, the Veh. did not modulate the claudin-1 expression at the mRNA level, compared with the SN from the PHA- 
treated PBMCs condition. However, when the cells were treated with c-MIM-1, a slight increase (of about 20%) in the 
claudin-1  expression  was  observed.  In  addition,  according  to  the  Western  Blot  quantization,  this  trend  tended  to  be 
confirmed at the protein level, in a similar range of increase. Such results were also observed without any inflammatory 
stimulus (Supplementary Figure S2).

Figure 5 C-MIM-1 slightly increases the expression of claudin-1 in a cellular model of intestinal inflammation. (A) The expression of claudin-1 was assessed by RT-qPCR in 
the HCoEpiC cells, after 24 hours of treatment with either the Veh. or c-MIM-1 and stimulation with the supernatant (SN) from PBMCs treated with PHA (5µg/mL) for 30 
min. The claudin-1 expression has been normalized by the one of the housekeeping gene GAPDH, and the control conditions, without any treatment, have been set at 1. The 
experiment has been done once; each condition was performed in triplicate. (B) The relative expression of claudin-1 at protein level has been assessed by Western Blot in 
the same cellular conditions as above. The expression of β-actin has been used as a housekeeping gene for the protein expression. The claudin-1/β-actin ratios are presented 
in PHA-stimulated PBMCs SN conditions, respectively, after quantization of the Blot’s pictures, using the online ImageJ software (downloaded on the 2nd of May 2022). The 
Western Blots were run twice and the mean ratios ± SD obtained from each Blot are shown. The black dotted lines highlight the effect of c-MIM-1 compared with Veh.

c-MIM-2 Displays Anti-Inflammatory Effects in Human Primary Monocytes Exposed to 
Lipopolysaccharide
The role of TNF-α as a mediator of chronic inflammation,36 as well as the capacity of PGE2 in exacerbating the severity 
of  the  inflammatory-mediated  diseases,16  both  attest  to  the  necessity  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  effect  of  these 
factors when included in MI formulation at ULD. Interestingly, c-MIM-2 rightly contains PGE2 at the inhibitory dose of 
200 K, altogether with TNF-α and IL-1β at 17 CH, IL-6 at 9 CH, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at 4 CH. In 
order to assess the ability of c-MIM-2 to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, and in particular, in reducing the secretion of 
TNF-α and PGE2, a cellular model of human primary monocytes inflamed with LPS was chosen. One of the reasons for 
this model’s  selection  relies  on the  fact that  monocytes exposed  to LPS  produce  high  levels  of  TNF-α,37  and  PGE2,38 
making them a suitable model to test the capacity of c-MIM-2 to down-regulate their expression.

The followed protocol is illustrated in Figure 6A but, briefly, the cells were isolated from three different donors and 
then incubated with either Veh. or c-MIM-2. The inflammatory stimulus was delivered to the cells in the form of a 10 ng/ 
mL  LPS  threat,  30  minutes  after  the  initiation  of  the  treatment.  The  treatments  were  applied  for  24  hours  and  the 
secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and PGE2 was evaluated within the SN by ELISA assay. The results are 
presented  in  Figure  6B–E  either  as  a  percentage  of  the  cytokine  secretion  in  the  untreated  Ct  (-)  condition,  or  as 
a percentage of the cytokine secretion in the Veh. condition, these latter being set as 100% for each tested cytokine. As 
expected, LPS stimulation led to a drastic increase in TNF-α secretion compared with the untreated negative control Ct 
(-) (Figure 6B), thus validating our model selection. In these inflammatory conditions, c-MIM-2 led to a reduction in the 
TNF-α secretion of about 20% (Figure 6C) compared with the Veh. In the same manner, after LPS stimulation, which led 
to a high increase in the basal secretion of PGE2, c-MIM-2 induced a decrease in the secretion of PGE2 of about 30% 
(Figure  6D).  Finally,  as  c-MIM-2  contains  IL-1β  at  17  CH  and  IL-10  at  4  CH,  the  secretion  levels  of  these  two  other 
cytokines  were  also appraised  in  the  same  conditions.  However,  while  c-MIM-2  did  not  affect  IL-1β,  the  IL-10  levels 
were below the ELISA’s detection limit in all tested conditions (data not shown).

c-MIM-3 Displays Modulatory Effects on Interleukin-6 Secretion in 
Lipopolysaccharide-Exposed Human Macrophages and Granulocytes
Human macrophages exposed to LPS markedly produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6.39 The

Figure 6 C-MIM-2 diminished the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human primary monocytes. (A) Experimental scheme for the cytokines secretion assessment 
in presence of c-MIM-2. Human primary monocytes were treated during 24 hours with either Veh. or c-MIM-2. LPS (10 ng/mL) was added to the medium 30 minutes after 
the treatment initiation, as an induced or the inflammatory conditions. The levels of secreted (B and C) TNF-α and (D and E) PGE2 were assessed in the culture media at 
the end of the incubation time by ELISA assay. The results are presented as the mean percentage ± SD of the values obtained for each donor. Each condition was performed 
in triplicate for each donor (3 donors) and in duplicate for the LPS conditions. The results are presented either as a percentage of the Ct (-) secretion or as a percentage of 
the Veh. secretion (set at 100%). The black dotted lines highlight the effect of c-MIM-2 compared with Veh.

macrophages. The experimental scheme is illustrated in Figure 7A, but briefly, CD14+-cells were isolated from one healthy donor 
and were incubated for 6 days in a macrophage-differentiation medium supplemented with M-CSF 100 ng/mL. At day 6 (D6), 
the cells were treated with 100 ng/mL LPS concomitantly with either the Veh. or c-MIM-3 for a period of 24 hours or 48 hours. 
The amount of IL-6 released in the SN was quantified by ELISA at the end of the two tested incubation periods. As expected, 24 
hours  of  LPS-stimulation  induced  a  drastic  increase  in  the  secretion  of  IL-6  compared  with  the  untreated  control  Ct  (-) 
(Figure 7B). Interestingly, after 24 hours in presence of c-MIM-3, a slight decrease in the amount of IL-6 in the SN was noticed 
(about 10%) compared with the Veh. (Figure 7C). In the same manner, while at 48 hours, the induction of IL-6 secretion due to 
LPS exposure was even more important than the one observed after 24 hours (Figure 7D vs B), the reduction induced by c-MIM- 
3 was also slightly more pronounced (about 15%) after this longer incubation period (Figure 7E vs C).

Finally,  the  effect  of  c-MIM-3  on  the  IL-6  secretion  was  also  assessed  in  a  model  of  human  primary  granulocytes 
isolated from one healthy donor and incubated with either Veh. or c-MIM-3 for 19 hours (Figure 7F). The inflammatory 
stimulus was added one hour after treatment initiation, in the form of 1 µg/mL LPS. The levels of IL-6 were assessed by 
cytometric bead  array (CBA)  at the end of the incubation  period (Figure 7G  and H). As  illustrated in Figure 7G, LPS 
alone elicited a strong IL-6 response when compared with the Ct (-). However, this response was weaker than the one 
observed in macrophages. In this model, the effect of c-MIM-3 on the secretion of this cytokine was barely any different 
from the Veh.

c-MIM-4 Displays Anti-Inflammatory Effects in a Cellular Model of Neuronal 
Inflammation
The following part of this study aimed at considering the effects of c-MIM-4 in a neuronal model of inflammation. In 
order to do so, rat cortical neurons and glial cells were cultured in presence of a combination of LPS (100 ng/mL)/IFN-γ 
(10 ng/mL), to provide an inflammatory stimulus, and treated during 96 hours with either the Veh., c-MIM-4 or MK801, 
an  antagonist  of  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor  that  has  antidepressant-like  effects,  used  as  a  reference 
compound for neuron protection.40  The cell survival was assessed after immune-staining with an anti-MAP-2 antibody, 
which  is  specific  for  neurons.  The  TNF-α  release  was  investigated,  too.  The  experimental  scheme  is  illustrated  in 
Figure 8A.

The  results  about  neuronal  viability  are  presented  in  Figure  8B.  As  illustrated,  the  inflammatory  stimulus,  applied 
during  72  hours,  induced  a  decrease  in  cortical  neurons  survival  compared  with  the  control  condition  (about  40%  of 

Figure 8 C-MIM-4 displays anti-inflammatory effects in a cellular model of neuronal inflammation. (A) Representative scheme of the experimental protocol. Briefly, rat glial 
cells (astrocytes/microglial cells) and rat cortical neurons were co-cultured during 8 days before treatment initiation with either Veh., c-MIM-4, or MK801 (20 µM). The 
treatments were applied for 24 hours, before adding or not LPS (100 ng/mL)/IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) for an additional 24 hours. At this time, supernatants (SN) were harvested 
and frozen for further ELISA analysis. The tested items ± LPS/IFN-γ were incubated another 48 hours before neurons survival analysis. The latter was performed after cell 
fixation, permeabilization and staining with a monoclonal anti-microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) antibody, specific towards neuron cell bodies and neurites. Images of 
each culture wells were taken and the fluorescence was quantified. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; PS, penicillin – streptomycin. (B) Effect of

cellular death; Figure 8B, red histogram vs white histogram). As expected, the reference molecule, MK801, at 20 µM, 
applied during the entire 96 hours incubation period, restored the survival of neurons to a level that is comparable to the 
uninflamed, untreated control (about 95% of neuron survival, Figure 8B, white, red, and green histograms). Interestingly, 
while  the  Veh.  did  not  seem  to  impact  cellular  viability  (Figure  8B,  grey  histogram  vs  red  histogram),  treatment  with 
c-MIM-4 was able to rescue neurons from cell death (about 90% of cell survival, Figure 8B, pink histogram).

The  effect  of  c-MIM-4  on  the  release  of  TNF-α  by  reactive  glial  cells  (astrocytes  and  microglia  cells)  was  also 
appraised  after  48  hours  of  c-MIM-4  treatment  (Figure  8A).  As  observed  in  Figure  8C,  the  inflammatory  stimulus 
induced an increase of about 40% in the TNF-α secretion by activated glial cells, compared to the control medium. Veh. 
and  MK801  (20  µM),  both  displayed  similar  effects  on  TNF-α  secretion,  by  slightly  decreasing  it  compared  to  the 
inflammatory control medium. Interestingly, treatment with c-MIM-4 decreased the TNF-α release by activated glial cells 
by about 10% compared with the Veh. conditions (Figure 8C, grey histogram vs pink histogram). Taken together, these 
results  illustrate  for  the  first  time,  the  anti-inflammatory  potential  of  the  complex  MI  formulation  c-MIM-4,  and  its 
positive role in neuro-protection in a context of LPS/IFN-γ-induced threat.

The  cell  survival  was  finally  assessed  in  absence  of  inflammation  in  the  same  cells.  As  showed  in  Supplementary 
Figure S3, the treatment did not affect the neuronal viability, thus suggesting that the tested MI formulation only acts in 
homeostatic-disrupted models of neuronal cells.

Discussion
In this study, we focused our attention on several MIMs which, based on their compositions, and according to previous 
published  works,4,9,10  may  exert  anti-inflammatory  effects  in  different  specific  inflammatory  contexts  (Figure  2).  With 
this in mind, the body of data that we provide here particularly resonates with one of our works, in which we reported 
that the two unitary medicines TNF-α (27 CH) and IL-1β (27 CH) displayed the capacity to inhibit the secretion of IL-1β 
and TNF-α, in a model of human primary monocytes as well as in THP-1 cells, after LPS exposure.9

Here,  the  same  unitary  MI  medicines  IL-1β  (27  CH)  and  TNF-α  (27  CH)  (referred  to  as  u-MIM-1  and  −2, 
respectively)  were  assessed  for  their  anti-inflammatory  capacities  in  a  model  of  intestinal  inflammation.  The  HT-29 
cell line was thus used, due  to the  fact that  these human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells of  epithelial morphology are 
widely  used  as  an  in  vitro  model  to  study  absorption,  transport,  and  secretion  by  intestinal  cells.41,42  Under  standard 
culture conditions, these cells grow as a nonpolarized, undifferentiated multilayer. At basal levels, without inflammation, 
our  results  show that  they  express  mRNA  of  both  IL-1β and  TNF-α,  the amount  of  TNF-α being  more than  ten  times 
higher than the one of IL-1β (Figure 3B and C). Surprisingly, in their study, Eckmann et al were only able to detect IL-1β 
mRNA but no TNF-α in these cells.43 Interestingly, in TNF-α-stimulated conditions, our model showed an increase in the 
transcription of TNF-α, thus suggesting an auto-amplificatory effect of this cytokine on its own expression. Even if such 
effect was already highlighted in TNF-α-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in TNF-α-injected C57BL/6J mice,44 it is, to the 
best of our knowledge, the first time that such an auto-inducive effect of TNF-α was reported in a colonic epithelial cell 
model. In any event, in this model of inflamed HT-29 cells, both u-MIM-1 and u-MIM-2, when employed at 27 CH, were 
able  to  down-regulate  mRNA  levels  of  IL-1β  and  TNF-α  (Figure  3B  and  C).  These  results  let  us  assume  that  c-MIM 
formulations including these two factors at ULD could display interesting anti-inflammatory properties.

The  intestine  is  the  largest  barrier  to  the  external  environment  and  preserving  its  integrity  is  crucial  for  the  whole- 
body  homeostasis.  Cytokines  are  known  to  play  an  important  role  in  maintaining  intestinal  homeostasis  as  they 
coordinate  diverse  functions  of  the  intestinal  epithelium  (proliferation,  viability,  barrier  permeability),  as  well  as  they 
orchestrate the communication between intestinal cells and resident immune cells.45  In particular, multiple studies have 
revealed  the  protective  effects  of  IL-10  in  maintaining  a  healthy  intestinal  epithelium  and  a  good  balance  between 
permeability and barrier functions.46–48  The observed effects of c-MIM-1 in our in vitro intestinal model, which, alone, 
could  limit  the  barrier  disruption  induced  by  the  pro-inflammatory  cocktail  provided  by  SN  from  PHA-stimulated 
PBMCs (Figure 4), are in line with these pieces of evidence. It should also be noted that c-MIM-1 employs LD of IL- 
10  together  with  ULD  of  IL-1β,  TNF-α,  and  IL-8.  These  three  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  are  involved  in  both  the 
initiation  and  the  progression  of  the  inflammatory  environment  which  leads  to  intestinal  injury,  increased  intestinal 
permeability, and the development of intestinal inflammatory-related diseases.14,49,50 Counteracting the elevated levels of

pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  the  intestine  may  be  a  valid  therapeutic  solution  in  various  intestinal  inflammatory 
disorders.33,51  Keeping in mind that c-MIM-1’s formulation includes ULD of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL- 
1β,  and  IL-8,  it  is  important  to  consider  that  their  ULD  employ  may  have  downregulated  the  physiological/biological 
effects  of  these  cytokines,  helping  in  restoring  the  epithelial  permeability  and  the  tight  junctions’  proteins’  expression 
impaired by the inflammatory condition induced in vitro. Precisely, while additional studies are necessary to confirm the 
beneficial effects of c-MIM-1 and to understand its mode of action, our results revealed that it could act on claudin-1, as 
it slightly increased its expression, both at mRNA and at protein levels (Figure 5).

Previous pieces of evidence have indeed demonstrated that inflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-α exposure, lead to the 
reduction of claudin-1 expression and an altered epithelial permeability.52 Moreover, Maria-Ferreira et al also reported that 
IL-1β treatment led to a decrease in claudin-1 protein expression in Caco-2 cells.53 Although no direct evidence of the role 
of IL-8 in claudin-1 regulation has been reported yet, this cytokine was however demonstrated to exert an inhibitory effect 
towards the mRNA expression of claudin-5 and occludin, in a dose- and in a time-dependent fashion, in endothelial cells.54 
On the other hand, c-MIM-1 also contains LD of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, with the intention to stimulate the 
conventional  cellular  responses  to  this  cytokine.  While  the  relationship  between  IL-10  and  claudin-1  still  needs  to  be 
refined, it was reported that claudin-1 localization was altered in liver cells from a model of IL-10-knocked-out mice, in 
which  colitis  was  induced  with  dinitrobenzene  sulfonic  acid.55  Altogether,  these  data  let  us  presume  that  the  effect  of 
c-MIM-1 on claudin-1 expression (Figure 5) could be attributable to the presence of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 in ULD in its 
formulation,  as  well  as  IL-10  at  LD,  and  highlight  the  fact  that  a  deeper  analysis  of  c-MIM-1’s  global  effect  on  the 
expression of tight junctions’ proteins could be envisioned in the future.

Regarding  the  interconnection  between  the  gut  and  the  immune  axis,  and  taking  into  consideration  the  crucial 
involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines in IBD, our results about the effects of c-MIM-2 on the secretion of TNF- 
α and PGE2 in an LPS-stimulated human primary monocyte model are quite encouraging (Figure 6C, E). It has indeed 
been  reported  that  TNF  initiated  different  and  redundant  cellular  cascades  participating  in  IBD  development.  In 
particular, TNF was shown to contribute to the generation of an IL-12 and IFN-γ-driven Th1-like response, and to the 
activation of a pathogenic CD8+  T cell compartment, in the TnfΔARE  IBD mouse model, supporting the link between gut 
and  immunity.56  Moreover,  not  only  PGE2  is  involved  in  the  regulation  of  immune-related  patterns,57  but  it  was  also 
shown  to  be  involved  in  IBD  development  in  mice,  especially  through  its  regulatory  effect  towards  the  IL-17/IL-23 
axis.58  The  observed  reduction  in  the  secretion  of  these  two  factors,  TNF-α  and  PGE2,  after  c-MIM-2  treatment, 
suggested the possible direct involvement of the two active substances, TNF-α (17 CH) and PGE2 (200 K), respectively. 
In addition, such secretion’s reduction also suggested the involvement of IL-1β (17 CH), as IL-1β is directly implicated 
in  the  TNF-α  gene  expression  in  a  PKC-dependent  manner,59  and  in  PGE2  expression  through  cAMP-PKA  signaling 
pathway.60

Given  the  importance  of  IL-6  in  inflammatory  responses  and  inflammatory-mediated  diseases,  including  IBD,  our 
research  focused  on  this  cytokine.  It  has  been  reported  that  cultures  of  isolated  lamina  propria  mononuclear  cells  and 
mucosal tissues from IBD patients exhibited higher IL-6 activity than healthy controls.61  This study also suggested that 
the local elevation of IL-6 activity could be a characteristic of active IBD and that, macrophages and colonic epithelial 
cells could be the responsible cells for this phenomenon. In this regard, our results showing a reduction of the levels of 
IL-6  secretion  in  c-MIM-3-treated  inflamed-macrophages  (Figure  7C,  7E),  are  quite  encouraging  and  highlight  the 
potential  of  c-MIM-3  to  be  used  to  decrease  the  inflammation  in  pathologies  such  as  IBD.  Moreover,  preclinical  and 
clinical research studies support the fact that circulating levels of IL-6 are also elevated in several chronic inflammation- 
mediated diseases other than IBD, like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, and 
psoriasis.62 Thus, even if more studies are needed, these data could open the anti-inflammatory action’s scope of c-MIM- 
3 to various pathological conditions related to inflammation in the future. On another hand, the different extents in IL-6 
inhibition observed after c-MIM-3 treatment in macrophages and in granulocytes (Figure 7C, E, and H) confirmed the 
necessity of an in-depth understanding of how MIM’s formulations work, especially towards immune-populations. At the 
moment, it can be speculated that the effect of c-MIM-3 on the two assessed models could have depended on the degree 
of IL-6 release induced by the inflammatory stimulus. The results obtained in our study suggest that the inhibitory effect 
of c-MIM-3 on IL-6 occurs when the levels of IL-6 are very important (Figure B, D, and G). One of the limitations of the

analysis here is that the experimental protocols were not exactly the same between the two models and further studies are 
definitely  needed  in  order  to  compare  the  responses  of  the  immune  cells  regarding  c-MIM-3  treatment,  at  different 
extents of inflammation.

Finally,  it  is  also  important  to  highlight  that  c-MIM-3  employs  IL-6  at  9  CH,  and  this  dilution  belongs  to  the 
modulatory dilutions of ULD-based MIM. While further studies aiming at assessing the cellular effects of unitaries MIM 
employing modulatory ULD are necessary, this study discusses for the first time the results of a complex MIM that uses 
a cytokine at 9 CH, on its own secretion.

In their work, Mizuno et al reported the direct effect of IFN-γ on neurons; as they observed the formation of dendritic 
beads containing proteins from collapsed cytoskeletal structures mediating neuronal dysfunctions, without increasing cell 
death.63  However,  when  IFN-γ  is  combined  with  pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  including  TNF-α,  the  neurotoxicity  is 
exacerbated and neurons viability decreases.64  Coherently with these previous pieces of evidence, the neuronal inflam-
matory model used in the present study, that combined LPS and IFN-γ, induced an important neurotoxicity (Figure 8). 
However, the tested c-MIM-4 formulation was able to almost rescue the neuronal viability and slightly reduce the release 
of TNF-α. Thus, it can reasonably be hypothesized that the observed c-MIM-4’s effect on neuronal cytotoxicity reduction 
could be due, at least partially, to the presence of ULD of TNF-α in its formulation, as this active ingredient may also be 
the direct mediator of the observed c-MIM-4’ effect on TNF-α secretion. Moreover, the ULD of IL-12 in its formulation 
may  also  have  had  an  effect  on  the  reduction  in  the  TNF-α  secretion,  as  it  was  reported  that  IL-12p40  monomer  and 
homodimer  induced  TNF-α  production  in  mouse  BV-2  microglial  cells,  mouse  primary  microglia  and  peritoneal 
macrophages.65

The research at the frontiers of immunology and neuroscience has identified multiple points of convergence between 
the  immune  system  and  the  nervous  system.  Thanks  to  the  overall  molecular  mechanistic  studies  on  this  concern,  the 
knowledge about the neuro-immune interactions has advanced greatly. Nowadays, a growing body of evidences supports 
that,  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  such  as  TNF-α  and  IL-1β,  and  the  clinical  situation  related  to  their  uncontrolled 
overexpression,  also  referred  as  chronic  inflammation,  are  extremely  linked  with  the  establishment  of  pathological/ 
chronic pain.66  Pain is considered chronic and pathological when it lasts at least 3 months.67  It has been demonstrated 
that sensory neurons express cytokine receptors, including IL-1βR, TNF-αR, IL-6R, and G protein-coupled receptors for 
serotonin,  histamine,  and  PGE2.68,69  Activation  of  these  receptors  expressed  by  nearby  nociceptive  neurons  leads  to 
enhanced membrane excitability and sensitization, which in turn, induce an over the responsiveness of those neurons, and 
the consequent development of pathological pain.69 Downregulating these pro-inflammatory mediators may represent the 
key strategy to improve chronic inflammation and the related pain. The therapeutic potentials of the MI formulations, by 
reducing the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β, and/or PGE2, and/or IL-6, can indeed cover a very large spectrum of chronic- 
inflammatory mediated illness and conditions.

Visceral  pain  is  one  of  the  major  impediments  of  IBD,  as  it  highly  affects  patients’  quality  of  life.  Interestingly, 
neutralization  of  TNF-α  was  reported  to  rapidly  decrease  pain  perception  in  the  brain  of  patients  with  Crohn's  disease 
responding  to  anti-TNF  therapy.70  Moreover,  the  role  of  TNF-α  and  satellite  glial  cells’  activation  in  neuron-glial 
communication  has  been  highlighted  in  the  context  of  inflammatory  visceral  hyperalgesia,  in  a  model  of  rat-induced 
colonic inflammation in which intrathecal administration of anti-TNF-α (10 µg/kg/day) reduced visceral pain behavioral 
responses.71  With  this  data  in  mind,  reducing  TNF-α  secretion  through  the  use  of  the  MI  formulation  c-MIM-4  could 
allow acting on TNF-α-mediated neuron-glial communication axis, which may result in antinociceptive effects in IBD.
As  we  developed  all  along  the  article,  the  three  different  inflammation  contexts  and  models  used  are  all  intercon-
nected together as the gut, the immune cells, and the nervous axis are constantly communicating between them. To cite 
some examples, several studies suggest that peripheral inflammation linked to IBD could also be a potential risk factor 
for  certain  neurodegenerative  disorders.  For  instance,  ulcerative  colitis  has  been  reported  to  exacerbate  LPS-induced 
damage to the nigral dopaminergic system.72  As another example, a clinical study carried out in patients suffering from 
rheumatoid  arthritis  (a  chronic  inflammatory  and  autoimmune  disease),  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  electrical  vagus 
nerve stimulation in attenuating the symptoms and significantly inhibiting circulating levels of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6.73
Another  important  consideration  that  can  finally  be  developed  is  about  the  reported  comorbidity  of  depression  and 
chronic  pain  and  the  possibility  that  inflammation  is  the  common  mediator  of  this  comorbidity.74  Preclinical  studies

demonstrated  that  intracerebroventricular  injections  of  proinflammatory  cytokines  such  as  TNF-α  and  IL-1β  were 
sufficient  to  produce  depressive-like  behaviors  in  rats,75  highlighting  the  crucial  role  of  these  two  key  cytokines,  in 
neuronal inflammation and the related depression.

Conclusion
Overall,  the  present  study  highlighted  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  several  MIM  preparations,  which  all  include  in 
their formulations ULD of IL-1β and TNF-α, in three different contexts of inflammation. The main results of this study 
are thus put together and illustrated in Figure 9 and could be summarized as this: MI formulations containing ULD of IL- 
1β  and  TNF-α  displayed  anti-inflammatory  effects  in  several  models  of  inflammation  related  to  the  (i)  intestinal 
inflammation,  (ii)  immune-cells  mediated-systemic  inflammation  and,  (iii)  neuronal  inflammation,  and  could  all  be 
linked  together  in  an  attempt  to  control  the  inflammation  within  the  body.  In  conclusion,  it  can  be  said  that  u-MIM-1 
and −2 down-regulated the mRNA expression of both IL-1β and TNF-α in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation. 
In the same cellular model, under inflammatory conditions mimicked by incubation with SN from PHA-treated PBMCs, 
c-MIM-1  allowed  a  restoration  of  the  epithelial  resistance,  probably  due  to  an  increase  in  the  expression  of  the  tight

junctions’ protein, claudin-1. In addition, MIM-2 and −3 were shown to decrease the secretion of the pro-inflammatory 
factors TNF-α, PGE2, and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated monocytes/macrophages. Finally, c-MIM-4 was able to restore the cell 
viability of murine primary neurons inflamed with a combination of LPS/IFN-γ, while reducing their TNF-α secretion. 
Even if more data are definitely needed, these results highlight for the first time that MI formulations may be a useful 
strategy to manage a large spectrum of inflammation-related diseases, including IBD or depression.

Abstract: Mitochondria are organelles with highly dynamic ultrastructure maintained by
ﬂexible fusion and ﬁssion rates governed by Guanosine Triphosphatases (GTPases)
is crucial for
dependent proteins. Balanced control of mitochondrial quality control
maintaining cellular energy and metabolic homeostasis; however, dysfunction of the
dynamics of fusion and ﬁssion causes loss of integrity and functions with the accumula-
tion of damaged mitochondria and mitochondrial deoxyribose nucleic acid (mtDNA) that
can halt energy production and induce oxidative stress. Mitochondrial derived reactive
oxygen species (ROS) can mediate redox signaling or, in excess, causing activation of
inﬂammatory proteins and further exacerbate mitochondrial deterioration and oxidative
stress. ROS have a deleterious effect on many cellular components, including lipids,
proteins, both nuclear and mtDNA and cell membrane lipids producing the net result of
the accumulation of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) capable of activating
pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface and in the cytoplasm of immune
cells. Chronic inﬂammation due to oxidative damage is thought to trigger numerous
chronic diseases including cardiac, liver and kidney disorders, neurodegenerative diseases
(Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease), cardiovascular diseases/atherosclerosis,
obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Keywords: mitochondria, dynamics, inﬂammation, non-communicable diseases

Introduction
Mitochondria are one of the cell organelles that are characterized as round, bean-like,
seen as an oval shape under the electron microscope.1 They contain a dynamic
branched network that constantly fuses and divide under the control of speciﬁc fusion
and ﬁssion machinery2 which is consistent with the endosymbiotic theory of bacterial
ancestor evolution.3 By nature, mitochondria are a highly ﬂexible ultrastructure orga-
nelle designed to regulate the bioenergetics ﬂux of key molecular elements.2,4
Mitochondrial proteomics depict that around 1200 proteins are encoded in the nuclear
genome with only 13 of them being coded in the maternally inherited mitochondrial
genome.5 The overall dynamic nature of mitochondria is governed by Guanosine
Triphosphatases (GTPases) dependent antagonist activities called fusion and ﬁssion.
Bidirectional crosstalk between mitochondria and the nucleus is strictly controlled by
different signaling pathways and with the dynamic fusion and ﬁssion nature of
mitochondria.6 Fusion proteins can be found in outer membrane mitofusins (Mfn1 &
Mfn2) and inner membrane optic atrophy 1 (Opa 1). Fission proteins (Dynamin related

protein 1 (Drp1)) with other proteins mediate the mitochon-
drial ultrastructure process.7,8 So, balanced control of mito-
chondrial dynamics is very important which, if not balanced,
can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dys-
function is a condition characterized by loss of membrane
potential to decrease Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) produc-
tion, decrease respiration or oxidative phosphorylation lead-
ing to a metabolic shift to the glycolysis dependent ATP
generation that
takes place outside mitochondria which
increases the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS).4,9,10 Uncontrolled production of ROS can
further damage/distract the mitochondrial membrane and its
major constitutes like DNA, lipids, and proteins.11 These
fragments can initiate mitophagy to promote cell survival
or can induce the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis.12,13 Initially, this condition can be regulated by
mitochondrial fusion/ﬁssion activities. Fusion delays the
onset of apoptosis by inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation
while ﬁssion has a positive role in apoptosis.14,15 However,
the failure of such quality control can contribute to the
development of degenerative diseases like type 2 diabetes,
cancer, cardiovascular disorders, neuropathies such as
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease and age-related
disorders.12,16–20 Mitochondrial dysfunctions play a central
role in chronic inﬂammation through activation of signaling
pathways, including mitochondrial calcium handling ROS
production and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
kB).21 Damaged mitochondria and degraded mtDNA pro-
duce an accumulation of Danger Associated Molecular
Patterns (DAMPs) which can bind and activate membrane
or cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) to
stimulate inﬂammatory responses.22,23 Mitochondrial quality
control failure with the downregulation of mitophagy results
in spontaneous inﬂammasomes activation as a consequence
of mitochondrial ROS burst.24 Oxidative stress due to ROS
burst also damages endothelial cells, which are recognized
factors for atherosclerosis; decreased nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis contributes to hypertension, upregulates the secre-
tion of adhesion molecules and inﬂammatory cytokines, and
is responsible for the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins.25
Muscle cell mitochondrial dysfunctions lead to a reduction in
fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of glucose transport,
which is an indication of insulin resistance, and further
results in obesity.26 Obesity increases the likelihood of var-
ious diseases, particularly atheromatous heart disease, type 2
diabetes, breathing difﬁculties during sleep, certain types
of cancer, osteoarthritis and chronic periodontitis.27,28
However, the exact molecular mechanism of mitochondrial

dysfunction and its association with this chronic non-
communicable disease is not fully addressed. Therefore,
this review aims to describe mitochondrial dynamic dysfunc-
tions as the main determinant factors for inﬂammatory-
related non-communicable diseases.

Mitochondrial Dynamics and
Functions

Mitochondria are vital
Triphosphate (ATP) by the breakdown of fuels (i.e., glucose,
amino acids, and fatty acids) through a series of redox reac-
tions performed by a set of ﬁve electron transport chain (ETC)
enzyme complexes of the mammalian OXPHOS system.29,30
To control the required maintenance of mitochondrial mor-
phology in a dynamic environment, mitochondria continu-
ously undergo tightly regulated and opposite remodeling
process called fusion and ﬁssion activities.31–33 Fusion and
ﬁssion activity of the mitochondria is regulated by the coordi-
nated action of the series well-conserved GTPases proteins.
These are mitofusins(Mfn1 & Mfn2) transmembrane GTPases
embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane, Optic atro-
phy1 (OPA) is a dynamin-related GTPases associated with the
mitochondrial inner membrane or intermembrane space.34–36
Proper balance of the antagonist activities of fusion and ﬁssion
is crucial for fundamental mitochondrial integrity and func-
tioning including energy metabolism, ROS generation, and
apoptosis regulation.35,37 Fission promotes the removal of
damaged mitochondria by mitophagy to maintain proper
assembly of electron transport chain complexes. This can
allow mitochondria to exchange lipid membranes, and intra-
mitochondrial contents while fusion escapes autophagy-
mediated destruction to maintain proper mitochondrial
ultrastructure and elongation (Figure 1).23,35,38 Fusion allows
for mitochondrial interconnection, favoring mtDNA mixing,
signal transmission and exchange of metabolites with in-
network. On the other hand, ﬁssion ensures equal organelle
segregation between daughter cells and target defective mito-
chondria for their subsequent removal through mitophagy.39,40
The dynamic process controls mitochondrial morphology,
biogenesis, transportation and localization, quality control
and degradation, and apoptotic cell deaths.35,41,42

Mitochondria are integral to normal cellular function as
they are responsible for energy production through oxidative
phosphorylation; they synthesize key molecules including the
phospholipids and Heme, calcium homeostasis, apoptotic acti-
vation, and cell death.43–45 Mitochondria have a unique feature
of semi-autonomous in which exactly 13 proteins used in ATP

fusion and ﬁssion machinery,

production through oxidative phosphorylation are coded by its
mtDNA. The remaining 1200–1500 mitochondrial proteins
are nuclear gene products that are imported into the
organelle.5,46,47 The maintenance of mtDNA is important for
normal and efﬁcient functioning as it codes proteins for oxi-
dative phosphorylation of ATP production from oxidation of
sugar, fats, and proteins, as well as tRNAs and ribosomal
RNAs that are needed for their translation in the mitochondrial
matrix.48 As the principal functions of mitochondria are to
synthesize ATP from the oxidation of sugar, fat, and proteins
through the process of OXPHOS via endosymbiotic principle.
Electrons from reduced equivalents are transported along the
respiratory chain protein complex to generate electrochemical
proton gradient or membrane potential (ΔΨm) across the inner
mitochondrial membrane producing ATP.10,27,48 Under normal
conditions, 1–2% of electrons can leak from electron transport
chain and reduced to superoxide radical there by producing
reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will be detoxiﬁed by
the action of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismu-
tase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.49,50 However, when
the production of ROS overrides the capability of antioxidants,

oxidative stress will damage cellular macromolecules (i.e.
DNA, lipids and proteins). This is linked to multiple patholo-
gical conditions such as: neurodegenerative diseases; diabetes;
cancer; and premature aging.29,51 The damaged mitochondria
with cellular stress are removed by selective mitochondrial
autophagy called mitophagy otherwise damaged mitochondria
accumulated and induce mitochondrion mediated cell death.52
Fusion and ﬁssion regulate mitochondrial damage and repair
antagonistically; fusion enriches damaged mitochondria with
normal genome and proteins to escape mitochondria from
damage while ﬁssion, in contrast, destined damaged mito-
chondria for destruction by mitophagy.31,53,54 Alteration of
normal mitochondrial function results in signaling distur-
bance, energy-dependent disturbance, and genetic defects of
the mitochondrial genome.

are associated with metabolic dysfunction or disease.55 The
to remove
impairment of mitochondrial quality control
damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria leads to the accu-
mulation of damage associated with membrane patterns
(DAMPs) released from injured cells, cell-free mtDNA,
N-formyl peptides and Cardiolipin.56 Mitochondrial DAMPs
can bind and activate membrane or cytosolic pathogen recog-
nition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLR), nod
like receptors (NLRs), like those recognized by pathogen-
associated molecular pattern (PAMPs).57 Thus, it activates
different early-phase inﬂammatory mediators like tumor
necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukins, interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ) and ROS/RNS.23 These coexistences of cellular
responses to danger of oxidative stress and accumulation of
inﬂammation.23
mitochondrial DNA leads
to chronic
respiratory chain, NADPH oxidases, and
Mitochondrial
5-lipoxygenase are the major cellular sources of ROS
production.58 The byproducts of oxidative stress: ROS; and
RNS can also further generated because of inﬂammatory cell
activity.59,60 Surprisingly, oxidative stress activates several
transcription factors (NF-kB and activated protein 1) leading
to the production and activation of pro-inﬂammatory cyto-
kines, chemokines, and lymphocytes which in turn leads to
the production of more ROS and RNS, principally in the form
of superoxide, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite.61–63 This
self-amplifying and the self-
complicated bidirectional
sustaining relationship between the development of chronic
oxidative stress and chronic systemic inﬂammations outcomes
to modiﬁcation of DNA, tertiary protein structure, and lipid
peroxidation of the cell membrane. This further results in a net
accumulation of DAMPs that can further exacerbate the
conditions.64–66 Thus, in turn, it will have a deleterious effect
of damaging mitochondria synergistically leading to the deple-
tion of ATP production and promoting a switch to anaerobic
glycolysis.67 Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction with ﬁs-
sion upregulation prevents the elimination of damaged mito-
chondria producing ROS and RNS that exceed the antioxidant
activity is likely initiating factors in inﬂammation, aging, and
age-related diseases (Figure 2).44

Mitochondrial Dysfunction and
Signaling Pathway in Inﬂammation
Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that contain
different proteins used for biosynthesis, metabolism and
cell death or survival functions.68 The vast majority of
proteins are encoded in the nucleus and imported to

mitochondria after translated. Translated proteins were
shared with end-to-end collision fashion of mitochondrial
fusion movement along the cytoskeleton.2,34 Each fusion
movement of mitochondria is mediated by outer mem-
brane proteins Mfn 1 and 2 and inner membrane with
OPA1 catalyzed by dedicated GTPases.69–71 Since this
continuous fusion of individual mitochondria may produce
abnormally elongated mitochondria
that were non-
functional, an opposing process called ﬁssion becomes
available.32 The ﬁssion process prevents abnormal elonga-
tion of mitochondria by splitting a single mitochondrion
into two separate organelles.72 If the balance favors ﬁs-
sion, mitochondria become fragmented, small spherical
organelle while if fusion is favored, elongated and banded
together mitochondria will be formed.35 Mitochondrial
dynamics imbalance affects energy production, apoptosis,
mitophagy, mitochondrial movement, mtDNA stability
and the tolerance of cells to mtDNA mutations.73–75 The
abnormalities of dynamics dysfunction and bidirectional
signaling pathway between mitochondria and nucleus are
exposed to, constantly alter physiological, environmental
and pathological stimuli.2,6 As the center for many cellular
functions, especially in energy supply with oxidative meta-
bolism, maintaining mitochondrial quality control is cru-
cial for tissue homeostasis.23,39 Mitochondrial dysfunction
with the release of ROS and mitochondrial-derived
DAMPs contribute to initiating an inﬂammatory response
by invoking pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that interact with
receptors like those involved in the pathogen-associated
response.76 Mitochondria play a central role in sterile
inﬂammation through the activation of several pathways.21

Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling and
ROS Derived Inﬂammation
Mitochondrial energy generation in the inner membrane
through the electron transport chain by using oxygen as an
electron acceptor is the major source of ROS generation.77
ROS are produced by one-electron transfer from redox donor
NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen in mitochondrial
ETC especially from complex I and complex III.78 A redox-
sensitive inﬂammatory signaling pathway engages mitochon-
drial calcium handling, ROS production, and nuclear factor κB
(NF-κB) activation.79 The activation of NF-kB provokes the
transcription of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-α,
IL1, IL6, and IL8.77 Under calcium overloads, such as burn
injury or sepsis, the electron transport chain (ETC) becomes
dysfunctional and elevated ROS generation occurs. Such

Notes: The impairment of the mitochondrial quality control process may lead to an accumulation of intracellular oxidized components and their release as DAMPs.
Damaged mtDNA molecules, either TFAM-bound (green circles) or unbound (red circles) may be released as DAMPs. These, in turn, can activate an inﬂammatory response
via three distinct signaling pathways by interacting with by interacting with 1) Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 2) nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor

Mitochondrial- DAMPs Derived
Inﬂammation
Due to the “bacterial ancestor” theory of mitochondria, the
releasing of contents due to damage or dysfunction to
cytoplasm provokes an immunological response. In addi-
tion to mitochondrial dysfunction with oxidative stress,
several conditions characterized by an inﬂammatory
response (e.g., trauma, HIV, cancer) are associated with
increased levels of circulating mitochondrial DAMPs.
induce caspase-1 activation and the
DAMPs,
release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like IL1B and
IL18 which ﬁnally leads to sterile inﬂammation.58 In par-
ticular, mitochondrial DNA activates different inﬂamma-
tory responses through different receptors, (Figure 2)
triggering transcription and translation of inﬂammatory
cytokines. Uncontrolled and excessive release of mito-
chondrial DAMPs associated with severity and contributes
to the dysregulated process observed in numerous inﬂam-
matory and autoimmune conditions.44

Mitochondrial Dysfunctions
Associated Non-Communicable
Diseases
(NCDs) are increasingly
Non-communicable diseases
becoming the leading public causes of morbidity and mor-
tality globally.82 The leading NCDs encompass a cluster of
illness including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes
mellitus type 2, chronic obstructive lung disease, and
cancer. These NCDs have common and key modiﬁable
behavioral risk factors like unhealthy diet, lack of physical
activity, the harmful use of alcohol, tobacco use and which
in turn leads to overweight and obesity, raised blood
pressure, and raised cholesterol, and ultimately disease.83
Cardiovascular diseases accounted for most NCD deaths
(17.5 million NCD deaths), followed by cancers (8.2mil-
lion NCD deaths), respiratory diseases (4.0 million NCD
deaths) and diabetes mellitus (1.5million NCD deaths).84
Globally, CVDs being the largest contributor to global
mortality, accounting for nearly half of 36 million annual
NCDs deaths and produces immense health and economic
burdens.85

A common feature of all NCDs is excessive fatigue which
results from mitochondrial function impairment; the crucial
organelle responsible for cellular energy production.86 As
stated above, defects in mitochondrial gene results mutation
of proteins that involve mitochondrial dynamic activities then
proceed to its physiological activity impairment.34,35 The
mitochondrial genome is susceptible to oxidative damage as
a result of its residence close to the electron transport system,
mtDNA lacks histone protein (protects from damage), and
repair mechanism rather it Induces to apoptosis once it
becomes damaged.87,88 Thus, lack of repair mechanism of
damaged mtDNA means cells cannot copy mtDNA accurately
resulting in errors of transcription, deletions and mutations and
also oxidation from ROS results in a series of cellular abuse;
loss of membranes integrity, diminishing proton gradient caus-
ing less ATP production, unfolding and loss of cellular protein
afﬁnity for their respective enzymes, and releasing cyto-
chromes C into the cytosol stimulating apoptosis, all in
a continuous feed-forward cycle of cellular, tissue and organ
dysfunction to cause chronic diseases.87 Additionally, high
ROS concentration permits histone acetylation to predomi-
nate, which accelerates faulty nuclear transcription and thus
replication. This initiates the release of NF-kB into the nucleus
(a signiﬁcant pro-inﬂammatory cytokine which also damages
nDNA). Simultaneously, cell differentiation and apoptosis
signals are silenced with histone acetylation, eventually result-
ing in over-replication favoring tumorigenesis.89,90 As the
mitochondrial inner membrane is the main site of electron
transport chain, dwelling different enzymes and proteins
which are also becomes the main source of oxidative stress.
Enzymes and proteins (i.e. cytochrome c), and low-molecular-
weight redox intermediates (i.e. coenzymes such as ubiqui-
none or coenzyme Q) that transport reducing equivalents, in
the form of hydrogen atoms or just their electrons, down the
redox potential from respiratory substrates to oxygen: an
oxidative pathway composed of four multiple-subunit com-
plexes in the mitochondria which leaks 0.2–2% electrons to
molecular oxygen producing super oxide or hydrogen
peroxide.27 These enzymes and proteins are the primary tar-
gets of oxidative stress products like ROS and RNS, and it is
not surprising that disruption of function and structure of
mitochondria are now thought to trigger numerous diseases,
including cardiac, liver and kidney disorders, and neurodegen-
erative diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease), aging processes and multiple organ failure in septic
shock. Cardiovascular disease/atherosclerosis, obesity and
type 2 diabetes are closely associated with chronic inﬂamma-
tion characterized by abnormal cytokine production, increased

levels of acute-phase reactants and activation of a network of
inﬂammatory signaling pathways.91 Mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion because of unbalanced fusion and ﬁssion, genetic defects
of mtDNA or oxidative damage with ROS and RNS can
impair energy metabolism, the central alteration in obesity.8
Cells can manage nutrient supply by increasing mitochondrial
contents. However, persistent nutrient leftover devastates the
mitochondrial system and causes its dysfunction leading to the
accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid products to cause
fat accumulation and oxidative stress which damage endothe-
lial cells.92,93 Obesity is key in the development of major non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, cardiovascular disease and several classes of cancer
including colorectal,
liver, breast, pancreatic endometrial,
lymphoma and myoma.8,27 Dysfunctional
renal, prostate,
mitochondria create a vicious cycle of
impaired beta-
oxidation giving rise to the production of ceramides, free
radicals and inﬂammatory cytokines which damages the mito-
chondrial membrane (as shown in Figure 3) and DNA further

jeopardizes mitochondrial respiratory capacity.94 Oxygen-free
radicals may themselves initiate a chronic inﬂammatory pro-
cess in which the pathology is characteristics of obesity and
linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.95

Therefore, preventing chronic sterile inﬂammation
derived with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxida-
tive stress and DAMPs activated inﬂammasome can signiﬁ-
cantly diminish non-communicable diseases.97,98 Reducing
cellular and mitochondrial membrane and DNA damage and
loss of membrane integrity is important in preventing loss of
cellular energy and regulating cellular life span.99 Since
oxidative stress is the consequence of imbalance between
pro- and antioxidants species, supplements containing diet-
ary antioxidants and some accessory molecules, such as zinc
and certain vitamins, are important in maintaining free-
radical scavenging systems, biosynthetic capacity, mem-
branes, enzymes and DNA.100 Utility of oral mitochondrial

mitochondrial supplements also improves mitochondrial
function.86 Anaerobic and resistance training intervention
induced in a mouse model showed an increase in the activa-
tion of the signaling pathway involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis.101 Preclinical evidence from animal and in vitro
studies suggested that regular endurance-based exercise
intervention is known to be a potent stimulus for muscle
mitochondrial biogenesis.102 It is also shown that endurance-
based exercise increases muscle oxidation capacity of mito-
chondria by increasing the activity of citrate synthase and
respiratory chain complexes.103–105

Conclusion
Mitochondria are central to the regulation of energy metabo-
lism and cellular homeostasis due to their principal role in
bioenergetics, ROS production, ion homeostasis, apoptosis
and signal transduction. This organelle is highly dynamic and
can re-program itself depending on various environmental
and intracellular signals important for multiple mitochondrial
functions, including mtDNA stability, respiratory function,
apoptosis, response to cellular stress, and mitochondrial
degradation. The dynamic process of mitochondria may not
be balanced as a result of proteins required for fusion and
ﬁssion that decreases the crucial role of mitochondria bioe-
nergetics and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria
producing ROS.ROS generated by dysfunctional mitochon-
dria further damage mitochondrial of different organs and
tissues that cannot function properly to result in chronic and
age-related disorders. Non-communicable diseases that are
increasing worldwide in recent years are the consequences of
unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, which shares basic
mechanisms of mitochondrial defects, systemic inﬂamma-
tion, and oxidative stress. Consequent oxidative stress caus-
ing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress
leads to excess accumulation of food energy favoring obesity
and the development of other metabolic syndrome and
related complications. Maintaining the health of mitochon-
dria is very valuable and could aid in the prevention of age-
related disorders.

Background: Systemic  inflammation,  immunity,  and  nutritional status  are  closely related  to  patients’ outcomes  in  several  kinds  of 
cancers.  This  study  aimed  to  establish  a  new  nomogram  based  on  inflammation-immunity-nutrition  score  (IINS)  to  predict  the 
prognosis of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) patients.
Methods: The clinical data of 435 patients with ENTKL were retrospectively reviewed and randomly assigned to training cohort (n=305) 
and validation cohort (n=131) at a ratio of 7:3. Cox regression analysis was employed to identify independent prognostic factors and develop 
a nomogram in the training cohort. Harrell’s concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
and  decision  curve  analysis  (DCA)  curve  were  employed  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  nomogram  and  compare  it  with  traditional 
prognostic systems (PINK, IPI, KPI). Internal validation was performed using 1000 bootstrap resamples in the validation cohort. Kaplan- 
Meier survival analyses were conducted to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients in different risk groups.
Results:  In  the  training  cohort,  in  addition  to  several  classic  parameters,  IINS  was  identified  as  an  independent  prognostic  factor 
significantly  associated  with  the  OS  of  patients.  The  nomogram  established  based  on  the  independent  prognostic  indicators  showed 
superior survival prediction efficacy, with C-index of 0.733 in the training cohort and 0.759 in the validation cohort compared to the 
PINK (0.636 and 0.737), IPI (0.81 and 0.707), and KPI (0.693 and 0.639) systems. Furthermore, compared with PINK, IPI, and IPI 
systems,  the  nomogram  showed  relatively  superior  calibration  curves  and  more  powerful  prognostic  discrimination  ability  in 
predicting  the  OS  of  patients.  DCA  curves  revealed  some  advantages  in  terms  of  clinical  applicability  of  the  nomogram  compared 
to the PINK, IPI, and IPI systems.
Conclusion:  Compared  with  traditional  prognostic  systems,  the  nomogram  showed  promising  prospects  for  risk  stratification  in 
ENKTL patient prognosis, providing new insights into the personalized treatment.

Introduction
Extranodal  natural  killer/T-cell  lymphoma  (ENKTL),  characterized  by  malignant  proliferation  of  natural  killer  cells  and 
cytotoxic  T  lymphocytes,  is  a  distinctly  heterogeneous  clinicopathological  entity  primarily  occurring  in  Asia  and  South 
America.1,2  In  recent  years,  with  the  optimization  of  radiotherapy  and  L-asparaginase-based  chemotherapy  regimens,  the 
survival  rate  of  ENKTL  patients  has  markedly  improved.  However,  approximately  50%  of  patients  with  advanced-stage 
ENKTL usually develop relapsed/refractory (r/r) disease, and the outcomes in these populations remain dismal.3,4  Several 
prognostic systems, such as the Prognostic Index for Natural Killer Lymphoma (PINK), International Prognostic Index (IPI),

and Korean prognostic index (KPI), are widely used in ENKTL to stratify risk and predict the outcomes of patients, while 
these models do not produce accurate risk stratification to some extent.5–8 In addition, both the IPI and KPI prognostic systems 
were proposed for patients who were treated with anthracycline-containing regimens, such as CHOP and CHOP-like, and may 
not be fully applicable in the era of nonanthracycline chemotherapy.5,8 Therefore, it is extremely important to explore a more 
efficient and accurate prognosis evaluation system for ENKTL.

In  recent  years,  growing  evidence  has  indicated  that  the  inflammatory  response,  immunity  and  nutrition  status  of 
individuals  have  a  close  relationship  with  the  occurrence,  progression,  and  metastasis  of  tumours.9,10  Many  studies  have 
reported that the ratios of different peripheral blood mononuclear subtypes, such as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte to leukocyte ratio (MWR), play an 
important role in predicting the prognosis of patients with various cancers.11–14 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) 
is a critical inflammatory-related protein synthesized by the liver and has been shown to affect patient survival in hepatocel-
lular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.15–17  The levels of serum albumin (ALB) intuitively reflect the nutritional 
status of individuals and have been confirmed to be an effective tool for predicting the outcomes of patients with gastric cancer 
and haematological malignancy.18,19 The inflammation-immunity-nutrition score (IINS), which reflects hs-CRP, lymphocytes 
(LYM), and ALB, is considered a superior prognostic evaluation system indicator.12,20,21 However, the relationship between 
IINS and the prognosis of patients with ENKTL has not been further explored.

Therefore,  the  aim  of  our  study  was  to  develop  a  new  nomogram  model  based  on  the  IINS  score  and  traditional 
clinical indicators and to evaluate the performance of the evaluation system in predicting the prognosis of patients with 
ENKTL.  Additionally,  we  further  compared  the  prognosis  predictive  ability  of  the  nomogram  model  with  traditional 
prognostic systems, including PINK, IPI, and KPI systems.

Materials and Methods
Patients
The clinical and laboratory data of 435 consecutive patients diagnosed with ENKTL at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center 
(SYSUCC)  between  January  2017  and  October  2021  were  retrospectively  collected.  The  eligible  patients  were  defined  as 
follows: 1) histological and pathological confirmation of ENKTL; 2) newly diagnosed; and 3) complete clinicopathological and 
follow-up data. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) complications with other malignancies; 2) definite evidence of 
infection; and 3) lost to follow-up. The last follow-up date was April 18, 2023, and the overall survival (OS) was calculated as the 
time span from the diagnosis of ENKTL to the last follow-up or patient death. The study was carried out in accordance with 
the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments and approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of SYSUCC.

Study Variables and Cutoff Value Calculation
We obtained the baseline clinicopathological parameters of patients, such as age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, and haematological 
parameters,  including  hs-CRP,  ALB,  and  LYM.  According  to  receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve  analysis,  we 
determined the  optimal cutoff value for  each  indicator associated with OS and  grouped each  parameter as  follows:  hs-CRP 
score =0 (≤10.1 mg/L) and score=1 (>10.1 mg/L), ALB score=0 (>41.1 g/L) and score=1 (≤41.1 g/L), LYM score= 0 (>1.12×109/ 
L), score =1 (≤1.12×109/L). The IINS scores were defined as the sum of the hs-CRP, LYM, and ALB scores.12 The patients were 
then  allocated  to  three  groups  according  to  IINS  scores:  Low  IINS  (IINS=0),  medium  IINS  (IINS=1),  and  high  IINS 
(IINS=2 or 3).

Study Design and Statistical Analysis
The flowchart of this study is shown in Figure 1. All cases were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n=304) and 
validation cohort (n=131) at a ratio of 7:3. The Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to examine the balance 
of clinicopathological features and scores of several prognostic systems between the training cohort and the validation 
cohort. In the training cohort, a prognostic nomogram model was constructed by using univariate and multivariate Cox 
analyses  to  screen  variables  that  independently  related  to  OS.  ROC  curve  analysis  was  utilized  to  evaluate  the 
predictive  efficacy  of  the  nomogram.  The  performance  and  net  clinical  benefit  of  the  nomogram  were  evaluated  by

Results
Clinical Characteristics and Survival
The baseline clinical characteristics of all 435 patients are summarized in Table 1. In the total population, the median age was 
46 (range 7~83) years, and 67.8% were male. The majorities of the patients were in the early stage (stage I/II) (72.4%) and 
exhibited good status according to  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  Performance Status  (ECOG  PS) assessment 
(93.3%). Eighty-one percent (81.4%) of individuals had nasal cavity or adjacent tissue invasion. Only a few patients presented 
distal  lymph  node  involvement  (12.4%),  bone  marrow  (4.1%),  or  B  symptoms  (34.5%).  Baseline  characteristics  were 
balanced between the two groups.

The  median  follow-up  times  in  the  training  cohort  and  validation  cohort  were  51.9  months  (95%  CI:  47.9–56.0 
months) and 47.8 months (95% CI: 44.7–51.0 months), respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 84.2%, 70.5%,

stage (HR=2.945, 95% CI: 1.992–4.353, p<0.001) were associated with OS of patients. Then, we included variables with 
p<  0.05  for  Cox  multivariate  analysis  and  observed  that  age  (HR=1.862,  95%  CI:  1.170–2.965,  p=  0.009),  ECOG  PS 
(HR=2.857,  95%  CI:  1.537–5.313,  p=0.001),  Ann  Arbor  stage  (HR=2.189,  95%  CI:  1.310–3.656,  p=0.003),  bone 
marrow  involvement  (HR=2.587,  95%  CI:  1.172–5.710,  p=0.019),  and  IINS  (HR=1.429,  95%  CI:  1.051–1.943, 
p=0.023) were still significant independent factors of OS.

Construction of the Nomogram and Model Performance
In the training cohort, the prognostic nomogram was constructed according to the selected variables (Figure 2). The risk 
rating of each variable was assigned a corresponding point, which provides a visual representation of the scores for each 
risk  factor.  Larger  points  suggested  a  higher  probability  of  death.  By  adding  the  scores  for  all  risk  factors,  we  could 
calculate the survival probability of patients at different time points. We observed that IINS had a greater impact on OS 
than  ECOG  PS,  bone  marrow  involvement,  and  Ann  Arbor  stage.  The  constructed  nomogram  model  based  on  the 
selected factors showed superior accuracy in predicting the OS rate of patients, with a C-index of 0.733 (95% CI: 0.684– 
0.781).  The  calibration  curves  revealed  good  performance  in  predicting  the  1-,  3-  and  5-year  OS  of  patients  in  this 
population (Figure 3A–C). Moreover, the C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction in the validation cohort was 0.759 
(95% CI: 0.680–0.838), and the calibration curves showed good agreement between 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival 
probabilities predicted by the nomogram and actual observation (Figure 3D–F).

Comparison Performances of the Nomogram
Then, we compared the predictive ability of the nomogram with the PINK, IPI, and KPI models in terms of the C-index and 
AUC. In the training cohort, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.733 (95% CI: 0.684–0.781), which indicated better performance 
than that of the PINK, IPI, and KPI systems, with values of 0.636 (95% CI: 0.584–0.688), 0.681 (95% CI: 0.630–0.732), and 
0.693 (95% CI: 0.640–0.747), respectively. Similarly, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.759 (95% CI: 0.680–0.838), higher 
than that of the PINK (0.737, 95% CI: 0.662–0.811), IPI (0.707, 95% CI: 0.629–0.785) and KPI (0.639, 95% CI: 0.551–0.727) 
(Table 3). In addition, the established nomogram had the largest AUC in predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year OS compared to the PINK, 
IPI and KPI systems, both in the training cohort (Figure 4A–C) and the validation cohort (Figure 4D–F). The results suggested 
that compared with traditional  prognostic systems, the  nomogram  model  presented a trend  of  superior  predictive  capability. 
Moreover, DCA showed that the nomogram appeared to yield the most significant net benefit in terms of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS

compared  to  the  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI  prognostic  systems  in  both  the  training  cohort  (Figure  5A–C)  and  validation  cohort 
(Figure 5D–F), which indicated that the nomogram may has good clinical application value.

Discrimination Ability of the Prognostic Nomogram
First, we assigned patients to three groups according to IINS scores and found that patients with high IINS scores had significantly 
worse 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS than those with low IINS in both the training and validation cohorts (Figure 6A and B). Then, the 
patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the median nomogram scores. The results showed that in 
the training cohort, the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 93%, 89%, and 85% in the low-risk group and 75%, 60%, and 54% in the 
high-risk group, respectively (p < 0.001). In the validation cohort, patients in the high-risk group had lower 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS 
rates (67%, 53%, and 49%) than those in the low-risk group (93%, 92%, and 89%) (p<0.001) (Figure 6C and D). The constructed 
nomogram showed significant differences in OS between the different risk groups, reflecting the good discriminative efficacy of 
the model in predicting patient prognosis. The results indicated that the new prognostic nomogram model might be a useful tool 
for predicting the survival of patients with ENKTL.

Discussion
Here,  we  established  a  new  nomogram  model  based  on  IINS  scores  to  predict  the  prognosis  of  ENKTL  patients.  We 
showed  that  IINS  scores  were  a  significant  prognostic  factor  for  OS  and  that  patients  with  high  IINS  scores  had 
significantly poorer outcomes than those with low IINS scores. In addition, for the first time, we combined IINS scores 
with  several  traditional  clinical  parameters  that  were  independently  associated  with  patient  prognosis  to  determine  the 
prognostic value of the new nomogram in patients with ENKTL. Our results suggested that the new nomogram appears 
to  exhibit  superior  performance  compared  to  the  traditional  prognostic  systems  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI,  which  provides 
important reference value for personalized treatment of ENKTL patients.

ENKTL,  as  a  haematological  malignancy  originating  from  mature  NK  cells  or  cytotoxic  T cells  (CTLs),  exhibits 
obvious  heterogeneity  in  clinical  manifestations  and  prognosis.1,2  Although  patients  with  early-stage  ENKTL  exhibit 
a  good  prognosis  after  treatment  with  standard  radiotherapy  or  combination  chemotherapy,  patients  with  advanced 
disease  often  present  dismal  outcomes,  with  a  5-year  survival  rate  of  approximately  70%.22,23  To  identify  patients’ 
prognostic  risks  more  accurately,  researchers  have  gradually  explored  the  prognostic  value  of  the  PINK,  IPI  and  KPI 
prognostic  systems  in  ENKTL  patients.  However,  these  models  failed  to  accurately  delineate  risk  among  different 
populations or  to distinguish high-risk  groups among  early-stage patients.24,25  Previous studies have  demonstrated that 
systemic  inflammation  affects  the  occurrence  and  development  of  tumours  by  inducing  gene  mutations,  inhibiting  cell 
apoptosis, inducing angiogenesis, and activating abnormal inflammatory signalling pathways.9,10  A growing number of 
studies  have  illustrated  the  diagnostic  and  prognostic  values  of  inflammatory  markers,  such  as  LMR,  NLR,  systemic 
immune-inflammatory index (SII) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), in various cancers.26–29 Recently, a study found 
that the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), an inflammation-based prognostic evaluation system comprising measures of

addition, the sample size of this study was limited. In another study. Scholars analysed the prognostic predictive value of 
the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score reflecting albumin, serum total cholesterol, and absolute lymphocytes 
and created a workable nomogram model for personalized assessment. The results showed that the CONUT score was 
more efficient in predicting ENKTL prognosis than the IPI, KPI and PINK models.13 However, this study mainly focused 
on the impact of nutritional status on patient prognosis, while the impact of inflammation and immune status on patient 
prognosis  was  not  further  investigated.  ENKTL  is  a  distinct  subtype  of  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  frequently

inflammatory response syndrome caused by uncontrolled overactivation of lymphocytes and macrophages.32  Therefore, 
we  needed  to  explore  a  more  comprehensive  prognostic  system  that  could  reflect  the  inflammatory,  immune,  and 
nutritional status of patients to predict the survival of patients more accurately.

Recently, the IINS score, which is derived from hs-CRP, ALB, and lymphocyte LYM, has been reported as a strong clinical 
prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.20 A high IINS score represents reduced lymphocytes, hypoproteinae-
mia, and high hs-CRP, which often indicates high systemic inflammation and low immune function and nutritional status. At 
present, there have been no studies describing the prognostic effect of the IINS scoring system in ENKTL. In our study, the results 
revealed that patients with high IINS scores experienced a relatively shorter overall survival time than those with low IINS scores 
and demonstrated that IINS was a practical and effective prognostic indicator, which is consistent with those observed in some 
kinds of tumours12,21  Furthermore, in addition to IINS, traditional prognostic factors such as age, ECOG performance status, 
bone marrow involvement, and Ann Arbor stage have also been confirmed to be important factors affecting the prognosis of 
patients  with  ENKTL  and  have  been  included  in  several  traditional  prognostic  models,  such  as  the  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI. 
Therefore, we constructed and validated a new nomogram model based on both IINS and independent prognostic indicators and 
compared the  predictive  effect  of this  model with that of  the traditional prognostic systems  PINK,  IPI, and  IPI. The results 
showed that compared with the PINK, IPI and KPI models, the C-index and AUC values of the IINS-based nomogram were 
higher, indicating that the nomogram may have more powerful predictive efficacy and better identify prognostic risks in patients

with ENKTL. Our results provide insight into the relationship between inflammation, nutrition, and immunity and the survival of 
ENKTL patients.

However, this study has some limitations. Firstly, although the nomogram tending to have improved predictive 
power,  it  was  not  statistically  significant  enough,  possibly  due  to  the  limited  numbers  in  these  cohorts.  Further 
study  of  this  nomogram  in  larger  multi-institutional  studies  is  necessary  to  definitively  establish  the  effectiveness 
of  this  nomogram  in  comparison  to  other  established  predictive  models  commonly  used  in  clinical  practice. 
Secondly,  we  excluded  ENKTL  patients  with  clear  infections  in  our  study,  which  might  be  a  limitation  of  the 
prognostic  scoring  system.  However,  this  exclusion  ensured  that  our  observation  and  analysis  of  inflammation 
primarily focused on processes related to the tumor-associated inflammation, avoiding interference from infection- 
induced  inflammation.  This  approach  helped  to  reduce  the  impact  of  external  factors  on  the  study  results,  leading 
to  a  more  accurate  assessment  of  the  characteristics  and  effects  of  tumor-related  inflammation.  Furthermore, 
different treatment regimens were included in the study, possibly impacting the survival of patients to some extent.
In  summary,  we  first  established  and  validated  a  new  nomogram  based  on  the  IINS  score  and  traditional  prognostic 
indicators and evaluated the prognostic value of the nomogram in ENKTL patients. Our findings suggest that IINS may act as 
a strong prognostic predictor in patients with ENKTL. Specifically, IINS combined with traditional prognostic factors presents 
better  prognostic  performance  than  PINK,  IPI,  and  KPI,  possibly  providing  an  easy  way  to  identify  patients  with  a  poor 
prognosis and an opportunity to guide treatment and follow-up strategies to improve the outcomes of ENKTL patients.

Purpose: This  study  aimed  to  evaluate  the  diagnostic  value  of  the  different  Complete  blood  count-derived  systemic  inflammation 
indexes,  including  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (NLR),  platelet-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (PLR),  systemic  immune-inflammation  index 
(SII), and neutrophil to lymphocyte × platelet ratio (NLPR) in differential diagnosing the chronic calculus cholecystitis (CCC) and the 
acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC), as well as determining the severity of ACC.
Patients and Methods: 105 CCC and 88 ACC patients were enrolled. NLR, PLR, SII, and NLPR were evaluated in both cohorts as 
well as in different severity levels of ACC. The severity of ACC was determined based on the Tokyo Guidelines. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve and Univariate/multivariate regression analyses were conducted.
Results:  The  levels  of  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  significantly  higher  in  the  ACC  group  compared  to  the  CCC  group.  The 
optimal  cutoff  values  for  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  determined  to  be  3.89,  144.7,  896.8,  and  0.031  respectively.  NLR>3.89 
demonstrates the highest predictive capability with an AUC of 0.801 and a sensitivity of 72.73%. Multivariate analysis showed that 
NLR>3.89 (OR: 4.169, p = 0.004) and NLPR>0.031 (OR: 4.304, p = 0.005) were dominant in distinguishing ACC from CCC. In ACC 
patients, the levels of NLR, SII, and NLPR were significantly higher in the Moderate to Severe-degree ACC (MS-ACC) group than in 
Mild-Degree  ACC  (M-ACC).  NLPR  >  0.044  exhibited  the  highest  predictive  ability  with  an  AUC  of  0.778  and  a  specificity  of 
91.67%.  Multivariate  analysis  showed  that  NLR>6.399  (OR:  10.308,  p  =  0.000)  was  a  possible  independent  prognostic  factor  for 
accessing the severity of ACC.
Conclusion: Systemic inflammation indexes can be useful in predicting the risk of ACC and MS-ACC. NLR demonstrates the best 
distinguishing power and sensitivity for distinguishing ACC from CCC, while NLPR shows the best predictive power and specificity 
for predicting the severity of ACC.

Introduction
Cholecystitis is a widespread issue characterized by inflammation of the gallbladder, often prompted by blockage of the 
cystic duct.1  Calculous cholecystitis (CC) accounts for 95% of cases and can be further classified as chronic calculous 
cholecystitis (CCC) or acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) based on the severity of clinical manifestations and the rate of 
disease progression.2,3

Currently, Cholecystitis cannot be definitively diagnosed through a single examination. Diagnosis relies primarily on 
a thorough medical history, symptoms, physical examination, and imaging findings.4 The gold standard for differentiating 
between acute and chronic cholecystitis is the use of pathologic findings from cholecystectomy. During the pre-operative 
period,  imaging  of  the  gallbladder  plays  a  crucial  role  in  distinguishing  between  the  CCC  and  ACC.  While

ultrasonography  is  commonly  used,  it  may  not  provide  conclusive  results  in  some  patients.5,6  Computed  tomography 
(CT)  has  its  limitations,  including  the  risk  of  false-positive  and  false-negative  diagnoses,  radiation  exposure,  and 
potential  nephrotoxic  effects  from  contrast  media.7,8  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  is  accurate  in  differentiating 
ACC from CCC due to its superior soft-tissue contrast resolution,5,9 but it can be costly and time-consuming. The use of 
MRI may be limited to severely ill patients and may not be feasible in settings with limited medical resources.

Research is ongoing on the role of biomarkers in predicting the severity of ACC. Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) is 
a  widely  accepted  standard  for  assessing  the  severity  of  ACC  using  scoring  systems.4  However,  it  involves  collecting 
numerous parameters.

Thus,  accurately  diagnosing  different  types  of  cholecystitis  in  the  pre-operative  period  often  poses  challenges  for 
clinicians.  Nonetheless,  accurate  diagnosis  is  crucial  for  appropriate  treatment  and  optimal  patient  outcomes.4,10  For 
patients  exhibiting  symptoms  of  CCC,  elective  cholecystectomy  is  recommended.  Prompt  urgent  cholecystectomy  is 
imperative  for  those  with  mild  ACC  while  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  ACC  require  urgent  or  early  gallbladder 
drainage  in  addition  to  initial  medical  treatment  and  organ  support.11  Delayed  or  incorrect  diagnosis  can  lead  to 
complications, including gallbladder perforation, sepsis, and even septic shock. In patients with severe sepsis or shock 
caused by cholelithiasis, the mortality rate exceeds 60%.12 Therefore, rapid, accurate diagnosis and evaluation are crucial 
for developing the best treatment plan and providing timely and effective care when cholecystitis occurs.

Previous  studies  have  elucidated  that  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count  and  leukocyte  subtype  cells  are  valuable 
indicators  for  predicting  the  inflammatory  process  in  acute  cholecystitis.13–17  WBC  count  has  been  established  as  the 
primary biomarker for assessing the severity of cholecystitis.4  Elevated WBC count is often observed due to the robust 
inflammatory response triggered by gallstone blockage.18  In addition, Platelets also play a role in inflammation and host 
defense.19  Several  inflammatory  parameters  based  on  WBC  and  platelet  counts,  such  as  the  neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio  (NLR),  platelet-to-lymphocyte  ratio  (PLR),  systemic  immune-inflammation  index  (SII),  and  neutrophil-to- 
lymphocyte  platelet  ratio  (NLPR),  as  potential  valuable  indicators  in  assessing  the  inflammatory  process.  This  study 
aimed  to  evaluate  the  diagnostic  effectiveness  and  practical  application  of  these  systemic  inflammatory  indexes  in 
patients  with  CC.  These  indices  could  offer  a  rapid,  accessible,  easy-to-calculate,  and  cost-effective  method  for 
differentiating diagnose ACC from CCC as well as determining the severity of ACC, particularly in developing nations 
where access to advanced imaging and diagnostic tools may be limited.

Materials and Methods
Study Subjects
This prospective, observational, and single-center study was conducted at the hepatobiliary surgery of Wenzhou Central 
Hospital. The research was carried out from June 2022 to September 2023, involving 250 patients who had undergone 
cholecystectomy  due  to  ACC  or  CCC.  Histopathological  examination  was  performed  on  the  resected  gallbladders. 
Diagnosis of CCC and ACC before surgery primarily relied on a combination of detailed medical history, comprehensive 
clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations. The final confirmation of the diagnosis of both ACC 
and CCC was based on the pathological examination of  postoperative gallbladder tissue specimens.  The ACC patients 
underwent  further  classification  by  the  TG18  into  three  severity  grades:4  Moderate  ACC  is  related  to  any  one  of  the 
following  conditions:  (1)  elevated  WBC  count  (>18,000/mm3);  (2)  palpable  tender  mass  in  the  right  upper  abdominal 
quadrant; (3) the duration of complaints > 72 h; (4) marked local inflammation (gangrenous cholecystitis, pericholecystic 
abscess, hepatic abscess, biliary peritonitis, emphysema cholecystitis). Severe ACC is associated with dysfunction of any 
one of the following organs/systems: (1) cardiovascular dysfunction: hypotension requiring treatment with dopamine ≥ 5 
μg/kg  per  minute,  or  any  dose  of  norepinephrine;  (2)  neurological  dysfunction:  decreased  level  of  consciousness;  (3) 
respiratory  dysfunction:  PaO2  /FiO2  ratio  <  300;  (4)  renal  dysfunction:  oliguria,  creatinine  >  2.0  mg/dL;  (5)  hepatic 
dysfunction: PT international normalized ratio (INR)> 1.5; (6) hematological dysfunction: platelet count < 100,000/mm3. 
Mild  ACC  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  “Moderate”  or  “Severe”  ACC.  Patients  with  Moderate-  and  severe-degree 
inflammations  were  grouped  as  the  high-degree  inflammation  group  and  compared  with  the  mild-degree  inflammation 
group. The criteria for exclusion were established as follows: (1) Patients below 18 years of age or above 90 years of age,

(2)  complicated  with  gallbladder  polyp  or  gallbladder  carcinoma,  (3)  complicated  with  intrahepatic  or  extrahepatic 
cholelithiasis, (4) complicated with serious medical diseases such as heart, lung, brain or kidney, (5) complicated with 
other  acute  or  chronic  infections,  autoimmune,  malignant  tumors,  or  inflammatory  diseases,  (7)  non-calculous 
cholecystitis.

Blood sampling and Biochemical Analysis
Blood  specimens  were  collected  under  sterile  conditions  on  Day  1  of  hospital  admission.  EDTA-anticoagulated  blood 
sample (2 mL) was used for the determination of routine blood count through the Sysmex XE-2100 Hematology System 
(East Asia Company, Japan). Blood parameters, such as neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and platelet counts were 
all  recorded.  The  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  calculated  as  follows:  NLR  (neutrophils/lymphocytes  ratio),  PLR 
(platelets/lymphocytes  ratio),  SII  ((neutrophils  ×  platelets)/lymphocytes),  NLPR  (neutrophils/  (lymphocytes  ×  platelets 
ratio)). Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected into pre-coagulation tubes and centrifuged for the serum. The serum was 
then analyzed for various biochemical parameters including ALT (alanine transaminase), AST (aspartate transaminase), 
GGT  (gamma-glutamyl  transpeptidase),  ALP  (alkaline  phosphatase),  TC  (total  cholesterol),  TG  (triglyceride),  HDL-C 
(high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol),  LDL-C  (low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol),  Apo  AI  (apolipoprotein  AI),  Apo 
B  (apolipoprotein  B),  and  Lp  (a)  (a-lipoprotein),  CREA  (creatinine)  using  the  Beckman  Coulter  AU5800  Automatic 
Biochemical Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Co. Ltd. USA). Sodium citrate-anticoagulation blood sample (5 mL) was used 
for the INR analysis through the STA-R Evolution® Experts series (STAGO, France). All determinations were performed 
in the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the Wenzhou Central Hospital. The normal ranges of serum TC, TG, HDL- 
C,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  Apo  B,  and  Lp  (a)  levels  in  our  Clinical  Science  Experiment  Center  were  2.44–5.17,  0.40–1.70, 
1.16–1.42, 2.07–3.10 mmol/L, 1.00–1.6, 0.60–1.1 g/L and 0–300 mg/L, respectively.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.27 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was 
used  to  determine  whether  variables  were  normally  distributed.  Mean  ±  standard  deviation  (SD)  was  used  to  present 
normally  distributed  variables,  and  median  and  interquartile  range  (IQR)  values  were  used  for  abnormally  distributed 
variables, while categorical variables were reported as percentages. Comparisons between groups were performed using 
the  Mann–Whitney  test  and  Chi-square  test  for  numerical  and  categorical  variables,  respectively.  Receiver  operating 
characteristics  (ROC)  curve  analysis  was  performed  to  estimate  optimal  cut-off  values,  maximizing  sensitivity  and 
specificity according to the Youden index. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis for each factor were 
performed  by  logistics  regression  analysis.  These  parameters  were  treated  as  binary  variables  and  were  dichotomized 
based  on  optimal  cut-off  values  or  mean  values.  Variables  with  statistical  significance  (P-value  <  0.1)  in  univariable 
regression models were included in the multivariable regression model using the “forward LR” method to determine their 
significance  after  adjustment  for  potential  confounders.  All  tests  were  two-tailed  and  P-value  <  0.05  was  considered 
statistically significant.

Results
General Patient Characteristics
A total of 105 patients with CCC (36 male, 69 female) with a median age of 52 years (range: 18–80) and 88 patients with 
ACC (51 male, 37 female) with a median age of 56.5 years (range: 23–88) were included in this study based on specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The laboratory findings indicated that patients with ACC had significantly higher levels 
of liver function enzymes such as AST, ALP, and GGT compared to CCC patients, with GGT showing the most notable 
increase.  Conversely,  ACC  patients  exhibited  decreased  concentrations  of  TC,  TG,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  and  Apo  B  in 
comparison  to  CCC  patients.  Furthermore,  ACC  patients had  higher  White  blood  cell  and  neutrophil  counts  but lower 
relative lymphocyte counts compared to CCC patients. Detailed demographic information and serum parameter distribu-
tions of the patients can be found in Table 1.

Among the patients with ACC, there were 36 cases of mild-degree inflammation (M-ACC) and 52 cases of moderate- 
and  severe-degree  inflammation  (MS-ACC).  Severe  ACC  was  present  in  only  three  patients,  with  one  case  involving 
hepatic dysfunction, another with respiratory complications, and the third demonstrating cardiological dysfunction. The 
average age of patients with M-ACC was 50.4 years, while for the MS-ACC group, it was 59.5 years. Apo AI levels were 
notably lower in MS-ACC patients compared to those with M-ACC. Analysis of blood parameters revealed a significant 
increase  in  WBC  and  neutrophil  counts  in  MS-ACC  patients  compared  to  M-ACC  patients,  whereas  the  lymphocyte 
count was significantly lower in the MS-ACC group than  in the M-ACC group.  The additional laboratory findings for 
M-ACC and MS-ACC patients are shown in Table 2.

The Results of the Assessed Systemic Inflammatory Indexes in Each Group of Patients 
with CC
The  NLR  value  was  markedly  higher  in  ACC  patients  [6.444  (3.199–11.446)]  compared  to  the  CCC  group  [1.971 
(1.519–3.301), P <0.001]. Also, there was a notable rise in the PLR [169.121 (125.75–246.336) and 127.253 (98.612– 
174.706);  respectively,  P  <0.001],  SII  [1470.792  (689.186–2758.316))  and  440.228  (315.366–872.194);  respectively, 
P <0.001] and NLPR [0.030 (0.014–0.058) and 0.008 (0.006–0.015); respectively, P < 0.001], in ACC patients compared 
to the CCC group (Figure 1).

Furthermore, in MS-ACC patients, the NLR, SII, and NPLR values were significantly higher compared to M-ACC 
patients (NLR:9.747 (5.068–14.065) Vs 4.093 (2.020, 5.411); p < 0.001; SII:2218.176 (1176.878–3349.847) vs 932.005

there was no significant difference between the two groups in the value of PLR.

Comparison for Assessing the Discriminative Ability of Each Inflammation Indexes to 
Distinguishing AAC from CCC Patients
Receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve  analysis  was  conducted  to  assess  the  discriminative  ability  of  various 
inflammation indices in differentiating between AAC and CCC patients. The NLR demonstrated a sensitivity of 72.73%, 
a specificity of 80.95%, and an AUC of 0.801 at a cut-off of 3.89 (P < 0.001). The PLR showed a sensitivity of 68.18%, 
a specificity of 61.9%, and an AUC of 0.662 at a cut-off of 144.7. Additionally, the SII exhibited a sensitivity of 69.32%, 
a  specificity  of  76.19%,  and  an  AUC  of  0.777  at  a  cut-off  of  896.8  (P  <  0.001),  while  the  NLPR  had  a  sensitivity  of 
63.64%, a specificity of 86.67%, and an AUC of 0.776 at a cut-off of 0.031 (P < 0.001). Overall, the NLR displayed the 
highest AUC and sensitivity among the indexes assessed (Table 3).

In addition, ROC Curve Analysis demonstrated that NLR, SII, and NLPR might be acceptable in the differentiation of 
M-ACC and MS-ACC patients. The areas under the curve (AUC) for NLR, SII, and NLPR were 0.760, 0.723, and 0.778, 
respectively. The optimal cut-off values were identified as 6.399, 1261, and 0.044 for NLR, SII, and NLPR. Sensitivities

for NLR, SII, and NLPR were found to be 71.15%, 72.22%, and 61.54%, while specificities were 80.56%, 73.08%, and 
91.67%.  Nonetheless,  the  diagnostic  potential  of  PLR  was  not  supported  by  the  ROC  analysis,  as  it  did  not  reach 
a significant level (P = 0.309) (Table 4).

Univariate and Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis
Univariate  and  multivariable  binary  logistic  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  clinical  significance  of 
Inflammation  Indices  as  biomarkers  in  distinguishing  between  ACC  and  CCC  patients.  Variables  that  demonstrated 
a P-value of <0.1 in the univariate analysis were subsequently included in the multivariable binary logistic analysis, 
encompassing  TC,  TG,  LDL-C,  Apo  AI,  Apo  B,  sex,  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR.  Notably,  in  the  mutivariate 
analysis, several variables were found to be significant in discriminating between ACC and CCC, including Apo AI/ 
nmol/L  (<1.13)  (OR:  2.284,  P  =  0.031),  Sex  (%)  (OR:  2.369,  P  =  0.025),  NLR  >3.89  (OR:  4.169,  P  =  0.004),  and 
NLPR  >0.031  (OR:  4.304,  P  =  0.005)  (Table  5).

Furthermore,  the  univariate  analysis  identified  NLR,  SII,  NLPR,  and  age  as  risk  factors  for  MS-ACC.  Multiple 
logistic regression models further confirmed that age and NLR were significant independent predictive factors of severity 
in ACC patients. It was shown that when the NLR was more than the cutoff value, there was an increased risk of (10.308 
times higher) moderate to severe degree inflammation compared to the lower NLR (Table 6).

Discussion
In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  assess  the  diagnostic  role  of  various  systemic  inflammatory  indices  derived  from  Complete 
Blood Count in acute and chronic cholecystitis, as well as in differentiating between M-ACC and MS-ACC patients. Our 
research  revealed  that  elevated  levels  of  NLR,  PLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  were  associated  with  ACC  compared  to  CCC 
patients. Additionally, among ACC patients, there was a significant increase in NLR, SII, and NLPR in those with MS- 
ACC compared to M-ACC patients. We indicated that the cut-off values for NLR, PLR, SII, and NLPR in differentiating 
between  ACC  and  CCC  patients  were  3.89,  144.7,  896.8,  and  0.031  (respectively),  while  in  distinguishing  between 
M-ACC  and  MS-ACC  patients,  the  cut-off  value  for  NLR,  SII,  and  NLPR  was  much  higher  (6.39,  1261  and  0.044,

thereby potentially assisting in averting complications and fatalities.

Considering the four inflammatory parameters associated with CC, NLR has been extensively studied and is considered 
a reliable marker for prognosticating diseases involving inflammatory and infective processes.20,21  Previous literature has 
shown that NLR is significantly higher in acute cholecystitis compared to healthy controls, ranging from 5.29–12.16 compared 
to 1.73–2.98.14,22–25 However, there have been limited studies focusing on the predictive value of NLR in differentiating acute 
and chronic cholecystitis. Our study supports previous findings that NLR levels were significantly higher in acute cholecystitis 
compared to chronic cholecystitis.23 We found that an NLR value above 3.89 was significant in the ACC group compared to 
the CCC group, and above 6.399 was significant in the MS-ACC patients. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that 
an  NLR  exceeding  the  cutoff  value  independently  predicts  ACC  and  its  severity.  The  increase  in  NLR  cutoff  values 
corresponds  to  higher  estimates  of  inflammatory  severity,  which  can  be  attributed  to  an  imbalance  in  the  inflammatory 
response with elevated neutrophil levels. This imbalance may result in the exhaustion of the immune system and a decrease in 
lymphocyte counts, subsequently triggering an aggressive inflammatory reaction through the activation of the innate immune

system.26 Consistent with our findings, a study by Sang Kuon Lee et al observed a significant association between NLR and 
gangrenous cholecystitis (GC), where each standard deviation increase in NLR corresponded to a 48% heightened probability 
of GC.24 Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis has suggested that while NLR can predict acute cholecystitis, it may not have the 
ability to predict disease severity.25 The ability of NLR to accurately differentiate the severity of ACC is a topic of ongoing 
debate, potentially influenced by variations in severity grade definitions across different studies. Further research is needed to 
clarify this matter.

PLR, another inflammatory marker based on complete blood count values, has shown potential as a prognostic marker 
in inflammatory diseases and malignancies. In our research, we observed that a PLR of 144.7 effectively distinguished 
between  ACC  and  CCC,  with  a  sensitivity  of  68.18%,  specificity  of  61.9%,  and  ROC  AUC  of  66.20%.  A  recently 
published  study  has  also  indicated  that  a  PLR  of  148.13  could  be  considered  a  valuable  inflammatory  biomarker  for 
ACC, demonstrating a sensitivity of 77.9%, specificity of 76.2%, and ROC AUC of 74.14%.27 Gökçe F et al highlighted 
the potential of NLR and PLR in guiding CRP and leukocyte values in acute cholecystitis.23  while Turhan et al’s study 
identified  a  PLR  value  over  146.90  as  a  predictive  marker  of  complicated  cholecystitis.28  Furthermore,  another  study 
showcased that a PLR equal to or greater than 154.73 indicates severe cholecystitis.29 However, our investigation did not 
yield significant evidence for using PLR to assess the severity of ACC. Similarly, in a recent study evaluating PLR, it was 
found that it can identify gangrenous acute cholecystitis with a cutoff value greater than 175, but PLR was not found to 
be an independent factor for gangrene.18  PLR holds promise as a prognostic and diagnostic tool in various inflammatory 
conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its potential in assessing disease severity.

SII, as determined by peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, has proven to be a valuable indicator for 
evaluating the immune and inflammatory status of patients. Previous studies have shown its potential for diagnosing and 
predicting  various  diseases,  such  as  esophageal  and  pancreatic  cancers.30,31  In  the  context  of  cholecystitis,  previous 
studies  have  revealed  that  SII  levels  exhibit  a  significant  elevation  in  patients  with  acute  cholecystitis  compared  to 
healthy individuals.32  Furthermore, SII can serve as a positive predictor for the severity of acute cholecystitis.33  It has 
also  demonstrated  associations  with  short-term  outcomes  and  advanced  forms  of  acute  cholecystitis.13,34  Within  our 
study, we observed that the cutoff value of SII for differentiating between ACC and CCC was 896.8, and for predicting 
MS-ACC it was >1261. These findings indicated the potential clinical utility value of SII in assessing the severity and 
prognosis of acute cholecystitis.

NLPR,  also  describing  the  interaction  of  acute  processes  of  the  immune  system  and  immunobiotics  involving 
neutrophils,  lymphocytes, and platelets,35  has  not yet been  extensively studied in  patients with cholecystitis.  However, 
NLPR has been investigated as a routine CBC inflammation index in other diseases, such as COVID-19 and acute kidney

injury, showing potential as a risk factor or marker of disease severity.36,37 In our study, we have observed that the NLPR 
value  is  the  most  reliable  parameter  indicating  the  severity  of  ACC,  with  the  highest  AUC  of  0.778  and  specificity  of 
91.67%.  Moreover,  based  on  multivariate  analysis,  NLPR  was  also  identified  as  an  independent  risk  factor,  its  cut-off 
value for the predictive of ACC was 0.031. Further research is needed to explore the utility of NLPR in cholecystitis and 
other inflammatory conditions.

Our research encountered several limitations. Initially, the patient pool was confined to a single hospital, which may 
have restricted the broader applicability of the results. Additionally, the sample size of 193 cases, with just three severe 
ACC instances, was deemed inadequate. Subsequent studies ought to incorporate larger cohorts to affirm the efficacy of 
inflammation  indexes  for  severe  ACC  cases.  Lastly,  our  investigation  did  not  delve  into  the  correlation  between 
Inflammation Indexes and the development of postoperative complications.

Conclusion
Our research shows that indicators such as NLR, PLR, SII, and NPLR have the potential to differentiate between ACC 
and CCC patients. NLR demonstrates the highest sensitivity and accuracy in this differentiation. Additionally, an increase 
in NLR, SII, and NPLR, from specific cut-off values, but not PLR, can predict the severity of ACC in patients. Notably, 
NPLR exhibits the highest specificity among the studied indicators. Importantly, our analysis identified NLR as the only 
factor independently and precisely associated with the severity of ACC. These findings highlight the potential of CBC as 
a  readily  available,  and  inexpensive  test  for  predicting  the  severity  of  cholecystitis  early  on,  thus  facilitating  more 
accurate  clinical  decision-making.  This  approach  may  be  particularly  beneficial  for  medical  professionals  in  countries 
with limited resources.

Background:  Microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  are  generally  connected  with 
severe infections with lethal outcome in immunodeficient hosts. In immunocompetent hosts, 
microsporidiosis  typically  establishes  a  balanced  host–parasite  relationship  that  produces 
minimal  clinically  overt  disease.  Although  the  alimentary  tract  represents  one  of  the  main 
primary target tissues, the mechanisms of reaching other tissues during systemic microspor-
idian infections remain unclear.
Methods:  In  the  present  study,  we  tested  the  relation  between  inflammation  induction  in 
immunocompetent  and  immunodeficient  mice  and  the  presence  of  spores  of  E.  cuniculi 
genotype  II  in  selected  organs  and  in  fecal  specimens  by  using  molecular  and  histology 
methods.
Results:  We  reported  the  positive  connection  between  inflammation  induction  and  the 
significant  increase  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  occurrence  in  inflammation  foci  in  both 
immunodeficient 
immunocompetent  BALB/c  and 
(SCID)  mice  in  the  acute  phase  of  infection  and  the  re-activation  of  latent  microsporidial 
infection following inflammation induction in immunocompetent mice.
Conclusion:  The  results  imply  possible  involvement  of  immune  cells  serving  as  vehicles 
transporting  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  purposefully  across  the  whole  host  body  towards 
inflammation. With increasing number of records of infections, it is necessary to reconsider 
microsporidia  as  agents  responsible  for  various  pathologies.  The  elucidation  of  possible 
connection  with  pro-inflammatory  immune  responses  represents  an  important  challenge 
with consequences for human health and development of therapeutic strategies.

Introduction
Microsporidia are obligatory intracellular eukaryotic parasites belonging to the phy-
lum  Microsporidia  within  the  kingdom  Opisthokonta  infecting  a  broad  range  of 
animals  including  protists,  invertebrates,  and  vertebrates.  They  have  been  studied 
for  more  than  150  years  mainly  for  their  ability  to  cause  extensive  damage  to  the 
host  organism,  mainly  in  husbandly  important  farmed  animals  such  as  silkworms, 
bees, and fish.1,2  In mammals, infections typically establish a balanced host–parasite 
relationship  that produce minimal  clinically overt disease  in  immunocompetent nat-
ural  hosts.3–8  A  shift  in  the  balance  toward  immune  deficiency  or  hyperimmune 
responses,  however,  produces  overt  clinical  signs  of  disease.  In  the  past,  human 
microsporidial  infections  were  most  commonly  associated  with  immunodeficiency, 
so they were often diagnosed in AIDS patients, organ recipients, and children.3 Of the 
~1500  described  microsporidia  species,  17  species  are  known  to  infect  humans,  of

which  Encephalitozoon  spp.  and  Enterocytozoon  bieneusi 
are reported from most of the symptomatic patients.8,9  The 
first microsporidian successfully isolated for long-term cul-
ture,  Encephalitozoon  cuniculi,  belongs  to  the  best-studied 
microsporidian species with four different, not strictly host- 
II=“mouse”, 
specific 
III=“dog”, IV=“human”) determined according to the num-
ber  of  short  repeats  in  the  ribosomal  internal  transcribed 
spacer (ITS) region.10,11 Encephalitozoon species infect sev-
eral cell types in mammalian hosts, including epithelial and 
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and astrocytes.12 
In  addition  to  gastrointestinal  tract  involvement,  patients 
with  encephalitis,  ocular  infection,  sinusitis,  myositis,  and 
disseminated infection are described in the literature.13–17

With the establishment of modern diagnostic methods, 
microsporidia  have  been  detected  in  immunocompetent 
individuals,  such  as  travelers,  diabetics,  pregnant  women, 
and  the  elderly.9,–18–24  Immune  suppression  caused  by 
chemotherapy,  immunomodulating  drugs,  and  solid  organ 
or bone marrow transplantation, has been demonstrated to 
be  an  important  risk  factor  for  the  development  of 
microsporidiosis.25  Microsporidiosis  is  not  limited,  how-
ever,  to  immunocompromised  states,  and  infections  with 
these organisms occur in immunocompetent individuals as 
well.26,27  Furthermore, asymptomatic microsporidia infec-
tions have been recognized in the case of diseases with an 
ambiguous etiology, such as encephalitis or periprosthetic 
osteolysis.8,28,29 Microsporidia are often overlooked due to 
the  problematic  diagnosis,  resulting  in  the  increased  pos-
sibility  of  hidden  infections  causing  huge  damage  and 
various non-specific pathologies, often without application 
of effective treatment.30

The present study was designed to answer the question 
raised  based  on  literary  data29  and  factual  lack  of  active 
motility of microsporidia, if the microsporidian E. cuniculi 
could be secondarily  transferred to  the site of  experimen-
tally induced inflammation in cellular vehicles attracted to 
the inflammation focus.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All  experimental  procedures  were  performed  in  accor-
dance with  the  law  of  Czech  Republic  (Act  No 246/1992 
Coll.,  on  the  protection  of  animals  against  cruelty).  The 
study  design  was  approved  by  ethical  committees  at  the 
Biology  Centre  of  the  Czech  Academy  of  Sciences,  the 
the  Central 
State  Veterinary  Administration,  and 

Commission  for  Animal  Welfare  under  protocols  no. 
100/2016 and 35/2020, respectively.

Mice
Eight-week-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) 
and immunocompetent (BALB/c) mice originally obtained 
from  Charles  River  (Sulzfeld,  Germany)  were  bred  under 
sterile  condition  and  supplied  with  a  sterilized  diet  and 
sterilized water ad libitum.

Parasites
The  spores  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  originally  isolated 
from  a  dexamethasone-treated  laboratory  mouse31  were 
cultivated  in  vitro  for  the  purpose  of  the  experiment 
according to Kotková et al.32

Experimental Protocol
All mice were per orally infected with the dose of 107  E. 
cuniculi  genotype  II  spores  in  0.2  mL  of  deionized  water 
using intragastric gavage. The inflammation in experimen-
tal SCID and BALB/c was induced by the usage of 50 μL 
of  Freund’s  Incomplete  Adjuvant  (Sigma-Aldrich,  St. 
Louis,  MO,  USA)  inoculated  in  either  acute  (7  or  28 
days  post-infection  (DPI)  in  BALB/c  mice,  respectively; 
seven DPI in SCID mice) or chronic phase (56 or 77 DPI 
in  BALB/c  mice,  respectively)  of  infection32  to  the  hind 
limb  muscles  (Table  1).  Mice  of  both  strains  injected 
intramuscularly  with  50  μL  of  sterile  phosphate  buffered 
solution (PBS) at the same intervals were used as negative 
controls.  Three  mice  from  each  strain  were  separately 
examined  for  microsporidia  shedding  in  feces  on  a  daily 
basis  and  fecal  samples  were  stored  at  −20°C  for  further 
molecular  analyses.  The  animal’s  health,  mortality,  and 
morbidity were recorded at 12-hour intervals.

Three  mice  from  each  group  were  euthanized  by  cer-
vical dislocation every seventh DPI and sterile samples for 
molecular  detection  and  histology  were  prepared  from 
limb muscles and liver by the usage of a different pair of 
sterile dissection tools (Table 1).

DNA Isolation
Total  DNA  from  samples  was  extracted  as  described  by 
Sak  et  al33  following  bead  homogenization.  Extracted 
DNA was stored at −20°C.

PCR Amplification
Nested PCR protocols34,35 were used for amplification of a 
partial  sequence  of  16S  rRNA.  Encephalitozoon  cuniculi

genotype I DNA and ultrapure water were used as positive 
and negative controls, respectively.

qRT-PCR
The protocols described by Wolk et al36 and Dai et al37 were 
used for amplification of 16S rRNA gene of E. cuniculi and 
β-actin  as  a  housekeeping  gene,  respectively.  Each  run 
included unspiked specimens and diluent blanks as negative 
controls. Positive results were determined based on mathe-
matical  algorithms  included  with  the  LightCycler  system 
(Roche,  Praha,  the  Czech  Republic).  Results  were  deter-
mined  to  be  positive  when  the  fluorescence  signal  crossed 
the baseline at ≤43 cycles. The total amount of spores in 1 g 
of individual fecal or tissue samples was calculated based on 
the standard curve derived from serial dilutions of spores in 
water  and  fecal  samples  of  known  weight  or  recalculated 
based on the number of β-actin copies in the tissue sample, 
respectively.38,39

Histology
Tissues  samples  were  processed  by  the  usual  paraffin 
method  following  fixation  in  10%  buffered  formalin.  The 
sections were stained with Brown and Brenn Gram stain.40

Statistical Analysis
Differences  in  microsporidia  presence  in  inflammatory 
foci  compared  to  noninduced  site  were  analyzed  by  stu-
dent  T-tests  and  the  conformity  of  the  variances  of  the 
tested  groups  was  verified  by  an  F-test  at  a  confidence 
level  of  α=0.05  and  lower.  The  differences  in  the  spore 
shedding  frequencies  within  individual  groups  were  ana-
lyzed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests. All com-
putations were made using Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft 
CR, Praha, Czech Republic).

Results

in  all  screened  tissue  samples  at  least  in  one  animal  per 
group  (Figure  2A).  An  induction  of  inflammation  in  the 
acute  phase  of  infection  7.  DPI  in  immunocompetent 
BALB/c  mice  led  to  the  disappearance  of  microsporidia 
from  non-induced  leg  and  increase  of  their  concentration 
towards  induced  leg  in  all  experimental  mice  (P<0.05) 
from  14  day  post-infection  (DPI)  to  35  DPI  reaching  up 
to 7.8×102  spores per 1  g of tissue reported 1  week post- 
inflammation induction (Figure 2A). On the other hand, no 
difference  was  observed  between  the  occurrence  frequen-
cies  and  spore  burden  of  microsporidia  in  legs  in  the 
control group (Figure 2A).

After  secondary  induction  of  inflammation,  28  DPI  in 
the left leg E. cuniculi genotype II shifted to the new site 
of  inflammation,  especially  42  DPI  reaching  4.8×104 
spores  per  gram  of  tissue  compared  to  the  right  leg, 
where 3.0×102 were detected. Also the frequency of occur-
rence  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  in  a  particular  leg  was 
higher in induced legs, as the microsporidia were detected 
at  least  in  two  of  three  examined  animals  per  interval, 
compared  to  non-induced  ones  showing  the  presence  of 
E. cuniculi genotype II mostly in one animal per interval. 
The  occurrence  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  also  con-
firmed  histologically  at  42  DPI  in  the  left  induced  leg 
(Figure  1B).  Surprisingly,  induction  of  inflammation  led 
to a prolonged occurrence of E. cuniculi genotype II in all 
screened tissues of the experimental group (P<0.05) com-
pared to the control group, where gradual disappearance of 
E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  from  tested  tissues  was  observed 
starting  from  35  DPI,  indicating  a  positive  correlation 
between the presence of inflammation and the persistence 
of detectable infection (Figure 2A).

Encephalitozoon  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  detected  in 
feces in both groups of BALB/c mice in the acute phase of 
infection from the 2 DPI (Figure 3A). Induction of inflam-
mation by Freund’s adjuvant led to discontinued excretion 
of spores in the feces for 15 days after primary induction 
and irregular spores secretion after secondary induction of 
inflammation,  whereas  in  the  control  group  specific  E. 
cuniculi  DNA  in  the  feces  was  observed  significantly 
more  frequently  during  whole  experiment  without  any 
relevant interruption.

after  the  inflammation  induction  in  the  chronic  phase  of

infection  was  reactivated  in  all  experimental  mice  and

case  of  induction  of  inflammation  in  the  acute  phase  of 
infection (Figure 2B).

A  similar  effect  was  observed  after  secondary  induc-
tion  of  inflammation  in  the  chronic  phase  of  infection  of 
77 DPI with no specific migration of E. cuniculi genotype 
II to the inflammatory focus, but activation of latent infec-
tion  in  experimental  BALB/c  mice,  showing  a  significant 
increase  in  the  spore  burden  in  the  induced  group  com-
pared to control mice (P<0.05) (Figure 2B).

Similar to the experiment performed in the acute phase 
of the infection, a significant decrease in fecal spore excre-
tion was observed in the group with induced inflammation 
(Figure 3B). Although the presence of specific E. cuniculi 
genotype II DNA in feces was demonstrated irregularly in 
both  groups  of  immunocompetent  mice  until  the  55  DPI, 
E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  was  no  longer  excreted  in  feces 
after induction of inflammation in the experimental group.

Induction of Inflammation in SCID Mice
In  immunodeficient  SCID  mice,  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II 
was detected in all screened tissue already prior to induc-
tion  of  inflammation  (Figure  2C).  After  induction  of 
inflammation  of  7  DPI,  in  the  experimental  group  a  sig-
nificant  (P<0.05)  increase  in  the  number  of  spores  in  the 
induced right hind leg of 21 DPI reaching 7.8×105  spores 
per gram  of  tissue  was  observed  compared  to  the  left  leg 
containing 3.5×105  spores per gram of tissue. In addition, 
there  was  an  overall  increase  in  the  number  of  spores  in 
both  limbs  and  liver  of  induced  animals  compared  to  the 
control mice, especially 21 DPI. At the end of the experi-
ment, 28 DPI, however, the number of spores in both legs 
was similar and comparable to control animals, where the 
spore  burden  was  approximately  the  same  for  both  limbs 
throughout  the whole  experiment. The presence of spores 
of microsporidia in the site of inflammation in the right leg 
was also observed histologically (Figure 1C).

In most SCID mice, E. cuniculi specific DNA in feces 
were  recorded  starting  from  2  DPI  (Figure  3C).  Spores 
were  excreted  in  the  feces  throughout  the  infection  until 
the  end  of  the  experiment,  regardless  of  the  induction  of 
inflammation.

In  contrast  to  BALB/c  mice,  clinical  signs  of  micro-
sporidiosis,  including  bristly  hair,  hunched  back,  and 
cachexia,  were  observed  in  SCID  mice,  especially  at  the 
end  of  the  study  period.  However,  diarrhea  as  one  of  the 
main symptoms of microsporidiosis caused by E. cuniculi 
was not observed in SCID mice either.

Discussion
Microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  are  typically 
described as chronic, slow acting pathogens and, thus, less 

virulent than other pathogen groups. However, they are able 

to  multiply  successfully  in  an  appropriate  host  to  an  enor-

mous  amount  without  any  obvious  signs  of  infection  in 

immunocompetent  hosts,  revealing  that  high  infectivity, 

high  pathogenicity,  or  both  do  not  necessarily  predict  the 

level  at  which  a  microsporidian  pathogen  impacts  the  host 
population.33,39,41  The problematics are complicated by the 
fact that microsporidia are often overlooked and underdiag-

nosed, resulting in the increased possibility of hidden infec-

tions  causing  huge  damage  and  various  non-specific 
pathologies prior getting detected and successfully treated.28
Environmentally resistant life cycle stages of microspor-
idia, spores, are excreted in feces, urine, or sputum causing 
infection by ingesting contaminated food or water and less 
often by  inhaling  infectious  spores.42,43  Horizontally trans-
mitted  microsporidia  of  the  genus  Encephalitozoon  access 
host tissues by germinating in the gut lumen where infections 
are typically initiated in gut epithelial cells, and sometimes 
muscle  cells.  However,  the  target  tissues  –  those  in  which 
microsporidia  develop  to  the  infectious  stage,  represent  a 
species-specific  interaction  with  its  host.  The  alimentary 
tract is a common target tissue for the production of infective 
spores, and infection can be restricted to one portion of the 
gut or include several tissue types. The intensity of infection, 
including  the  amount  and  frequency  of  E.  cuniculi  spores 
secreted, depends on the age and health status of the infected 
individual as well as depends on the species and genotype of 
the infectious agent.42 The results of this work correspond to 
the data published by Sak et al38,39  and Kotková et al,32  ie, 
immunocompetent BALB/c mice shed E. cuniculi spores at a 
significantly  lower  frequency  than  immunodeficient  SCID 
mice.  The  sporadic  presence  of  E.  cuniculi  spores  in  the 
feces  of an  infected  individual  has  also  been  demonstrated 
in  other  studies.26,27,29,32,41  A  positive  correlation  between 
the frequency of excretion and the intensity of infection was 
observed in  BALB/c  and  SCID  mice;  while  BALB/c  mice 
excreted intermittently with an infection intensity of 3.2×106, 
SCID mice excreted almost daily with an intensity of 1.2×108 
spores  per  gram  of  feces.32,38,39  Similarly,  a  child  without 
clinical  signs  of  the  disease  has  been  shown  to  excrete 
1.2×105 spores per gram of stool,44 whereas an immunodefi-
cient  individual  can  excrete  up  to  4.4×108  per  gram  of 
diarrhea.45

structure, the 10–50 μm long polar tube, which is responsible 
for the delivery of this organism to the host cell. Nevertheless, 
Encephalitozoon organisms may replicate to produce mature 
spores  in  a  variety  of  immune  cells  including  resident  and 
trafficking  macrophages  and  other  phagocytic  cells  such  as 
neutrophils,  monocytes,  dendritic  cells,  and  eosinophils 
which may contribute to the spread of E. cuniculi throughout 
the  host  organism,46,47  suggesting  that  induction  of  chemo-
kines  for  inducing  innate  immune  inflammation  may  also 
promote recruitment of host cells for continued infection and 
dissemination48–50 On the other hand, there may be a situation 
in which microsporidia occurring in the area of induced inflam-
mation are eliminated due to the increased occurrence of IFNγ- 
,  LPS-,  and  TNFα-activated  macrophages10,–50–54  by  the 
means of cytotoxic cytokines, cationic proteins, lipid media-
tors,  metalloproteinases,  and  components  of  the  oxygen 
burst.10,51,55

Encephalitozoon  cuniculi  was  recognized  as  a  neglected 
etiological agent for more common, sometimes life-threaten-
ing diseases, such as encephalitis and meningitis, in otherwise 
healthy  individuals28  or  contribute  to  aseptic  periprosthetic 
osteolysis  after  primary  hip  arthroplasty,  leading  to  implant 
loosening  and  urgent  arthroplasty  revision.29  However,  the 
fact  that  microsporidia  occurred  in  the  affected  area  before 
the onset of inflammatory processes, or whether they enter the 
affected area secondarily, either through macrophages or other 
cells involved in the development of inflammation serving as 
vehicles  remained  unanswered.  Our  results  confirmed  the 
targeted  migration  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  to  the  site  of 
inflammation. Although E. cuniculi may be common in mus-
cle, as confirmed by Sak et al56 in a recent study demonstrating 
the occurrence of E. cuniculi genotype II in pig muscle, reach-
ing 60 to 250 spores per gram of meat tissue, in this work we 
showed that the induction of inflammation led to a significant 
increase  of  E.  cuniculi  genotype  II  at  the  induced  site  in 
immunocompetent  BALB/c  mice.  Compared  to  the  control 
group injected with sterile PBS, the occurrence of microspor-
idia in the limbs was random and, from 42 DPI, microsporidia 
in selected organs and tissues were not detected at all, suggest-
ing that during our experiment they may have been eliminated 
by  the  host  immune  system  or  microsporidia  remain  in  the 
body in undetectable amounts. Also induction of inflammation 
in the experimental group of SCID mice led to a significant 
increase of spore burden at the site of inflammation, while in 
the control group, the amount of spores per gram of tissue in 
both limbs was approximately identical. The high concentra-
tion of spores in muscle tissues at the end of the experiment 
could be attributed to the systemic spread of E. cuniculi in the 

terminal  phase  infection,  as  already  described  by  Kotková 
et al.32

So  far,  the  information  available  from  experimental  and 
natural infections suggests that E. cuniculi is able to spread in a 
host rapidly and survive in asymptomatic carriers for a long 
time period, but in some cases the E. cuniculi could be acti-
vated and trigger diseases with ambiguous etiology depending 
on the location. The results obtained in Kicia et al43 pointed to 
a significant association between the occurrence of E. cuniculi 
and  respiratory  symptoms  in  patients  who  have  undergone 
kidney transplantation. However, the question of if microspor-
idia occurred in the respiratory tract in these individuals prior 
to immunosuppressive treatment, as Kotková et al32 and Sak et 
al39 described the common presence of Encephalitozoon spe-
cies  in  the  lungs  of  immunocompetent  individuals,  remains 
unanswered. Our experiments suggested that E. cuniculi gen-
otype  II  could  be  activated  from  latent  phase  not  even  by 
chemotherapy,  but  also  with  inflammation  occurrence.  As 
induction  of  inflammation  in  the  chronic  phase  of  infection 
in  immunocompetent  BALB/c  mice  did  not  directly  affect 
targeted migration of E. cuniculi genotype II to the inflamma-
tory focus, but it led to reactivation of latent infection and E. 
cuniculi  spores  were  repeatedly  detected  in  both  limbs  and 
liver. These results correspond to the results of the study by 
Kotková  et  al,32  who  described  the  reactivation  of  latent  E. 
cuniculi genotype II infection in immunocompetent mice after 
immunosuppression, as well as the ability of this microspor-
idian  to  spread  to  various  tissues  during  chronic  infection, 
including muscles, and to persist at these sites. However, the 
mechanism  of  reactivation  of  E.  cuniculi  by  inflammation 
remains  unclear.  It  can  be  assumed  that  local  induction  of 
chronic inflammation could lead to a reduction in the capacity 
of the immune system, which previously kept the amount of 
microsporidia below the detection limit of the methods used 
(qRT PCR). Similarly, Bannoura et al57 described the reactiva-
tion  of  a  latent  Toxoplasma  gondii  infection  in  a  4-year-old 
child  after  application  of  steroid  hormones  against 
encephalomyelitis.

Unexpectedly, whereas the presence of E. cuniculi geno-
type II in the feces of control groups of immunocompetent 
BALB/c mice in both acute and chronic phase of infection 
was detected intermittently thorough the whole experimental 
period, in experimental groups the excretion of E. cuniculi in 
feces was  reduced  for several  days  or disappeared, respec-
tively,  after  inflammation  induction.  This  phenomenon  can 
be  explained  by  concurrent  increase  of  occurrence  of  E. 
cuniculi genotype II in foci of inflammation and disappear-
ance  of  the  parasite  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  towards

Conclusions
Based on our results we can conclude that the induction of 
inflammation  had  caused  increased  migration  of  E.  cuni-
culi  genotype  II  to  inflammatory  foci  as  the  frequency  of 
spores  was  not  random  but  shifted  in  favor  of  the  site  of 
induced  inflammation  compared  to  control  groups,  where 
spores were accidental or spores or their specific DNA was 
not  detected  at  all.  It  can  be  assumed  that  E.  cuniculi 
genotype  II  could  be  secondarily  transported  to  the  site 
of  inflammation  with  the  contribution  of  immune  cells 
participating  in  its  formation.  E.  cuniculi  are  also  able  to 
survive for a long time in immunocompetent hosts without 
any  clinical  signs,  under  certain  circumstances  the  infec-
tion  may  be  reactivated  after  inflammation  induction. 
However,  the  mechanisms  of  such  migration  as  well  as 
the  vehicle  cells  and  mechanism  of  infection  reactivation 
remain speculative and need to be specified in detail.

The  elucidation  of  possible  connection  with  pro- 
inflammatory  immune  responses,  addressing  the  tissue 
specificity and the mechanisms of transfer to target tissues 
represent  an  important  challenge  with  potential  conse-
quences  for  human  health  and  brings  novel  insight  into 
microsporidia problematic and developing reliable preven-
tive and therapeutic strategies.
