You will be given a section of research article in the <article> tags.
You should prepare training dataset from the article.
The training sample should have input and output both extracted from the article.
Each sample should be a dictionary with the following keys:
- 'input': The text of the article.
- 'output': The entities and relationships extracted from the article.


Below are the examples of the dataset samples you need to prepare:
- <sample>{'input': 'Insulin resistance (IR) is known to be characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
            and is regarded as an important mechanism in disease pathogenesis. One of the key pathogenetic 
            mechanisms  of  IR  progression  is  impaired  free  fatty  acid  (FFA)  metabolism.  Plasminogen-
            activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and key inflammation markers, ie, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive 
            protein (CRP), also play a role.',

    'output': {'entity1': 'Insulin resistance', 'relationship': 'characteristic', 'entity2': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus'}, 
    {'entity1': 'Insulin resistance', 'relationship': 'mechanism', 'entity2': 'disease pathogenesis'},
    {'entity1': 'pathogenesis', 'relationship': 'progression', 'entity2': 'impaired free fatty acid metabolism'},
    {'entity1': 'Plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'},
    {'entity1': 'Interleukin 6', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'},
    {'entity1': 'C-reactive protein', 'relationship': 'role', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance'}}</sample>

- <sample>{'input': 'Among  proinflammatory  cytokines  contributing  to 
        IR  development,  the  role  of  interleukin  (IL)-6,  which  has 
        autocrine and paracrine properties and is involved in insulin 
        reception and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism regulation, 
        has been extensively studied.',
        'output': [{'entity1': 'Interleukin 6', 'relationship': 'contributing', 'entity2': 'Insulin resistance development'}, 
                {'entity1': 'Interleukin 6', 'relationship': 'involved', 'entity2': 'insulin reception'},
                {'entity1': 'Interleukin 6', 'relationship': 'involved', 'entity2': 'free fatty acid metabolism regulation'}]}
   </sample>

Please follow the below guidelines:
- Provide the samples inside <sample> tags containing 'input' and 'output' in JSON format.
- You should extract as many samples as possible from the article.
- The input should be the content of the article and the output should be the entities and relationships extracted from the given content.
- Make sure the input is formatted properly before creating the samples. 
- The samples should be unique.
- The samples should have meaningful medical information.
- Ignore links, references, and any other irrelevant information.
- Each dictionary in the output should have the following keys:
    - 'entity1': The first entity in the relationship.
    - 'relationship': The relationship between the entities.
    - 'entity2': The second entity in the relationship.
